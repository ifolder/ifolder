The AddressBook is a project started because the iFolder project needed an
AddressBook.  The specifications for a "Common Addressbook" were not being
met so the iFolder team wrote an Address Book to the specifications that were
given in the "Common AddressBook" spec. AddressBook is free software, licensed 
under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
(see the COPYING file).

Building AddressBook
--------------------

    AddressBook is built on the Simias technology also maintained in the 
    iFolder project space.  You may obtain Simias by visiting the iFolder
    Project website.
        
    You will need to configure and install Simias before building AddressBook.
    We recommend they both be configured to use the same install prefix.
    If not, when you configure AddressBook you must specify where the Simias
    project is installed using --with-simias-install-path.  These assemblies
    must all currently reside in the same directory.  Eventually they will be
    strongly named and installed in the Global Assembly Cache (GAC).

Linux
------
    Tested platforms:
        SuSE Linux 9 with Ximian Desktop 2 (XD2)
        Red Hat Linux 9 with XD2
      
    You will need to have the following installed and working on your machine:
     
    - mono 0.31 (or later)
    - gtk-sharp 0.17 (or later)
    
    You can get mono and gtk-sharp from http://www.go-mono.com or Ximian Red
    Carpet.
       
    - automake 1.7 (or later)
    - autoconf 2.57 (or later)
    - m4 1.40 (or later)
       
Win32
------
    Tested platforms:
        Windows XP Professional
        Windows 2000 Professional
    
    You will need to have the following installed and working on your machine:
    
    - Microsoft Visual Studio .NET
    
        We currently rely on the csc and cl compilers from Visual Studio .NET.
        The MSI and MSM packages are also built using Visual Studio .NET.
        We hope to migrate soon to a Windows build environment that only
        requires the .NET Framework SDK, not Visual Studio .NET.
    
    - Cygwin
    
        We recommend installing the following packages in addition to the
        default packages:
        
        Devel: autoconf, automake, libtool, make, pkgconfig, cvs, gcc, gcc-g++
        Editors: vim
        Net: openssh, openssl
        Text: more
        Utils: clear
        
        If your Windows environment is not set up to find the Visual Studio
        .NET tools, add the following line to cygwin.bat somewhere before it
        starts up the bash shell:
        
        call "%VS71COMNTOOLS%\vsvars32.bat" > NUL

OS X
-----
    We are working to get AddressBook working on OS X. Right now there are some 
    issues too large to cover here.  Once you do get mono going on OS X, the
    Simias project should work much like it does on Linux.

All Platforms
--------------
    To compile from a source distribution:
        ./configure --prefix=<install_path>
        make
        make install
    
    To compile source from CVS:
        ./autogen.sh --prefix=<install_path>
        make
        make install
