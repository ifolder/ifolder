iFolder.Client is a good start to a lite weight iFolder client libary written in C#.

With the checked in code, you can add and remove yourself from an iFolder Domain.  Login to joined
domains as well as enumerate joined domains.

You can also create and delete remote iFolders, subscribe and unsubscribe to remote iFolders and
list available/remote and subscribed iFolders.

My goal with this libary is to produce a photo pushing application for my Mobile 5.0 device.
Currently the library has some problems running against the .NET Compact framework.  For example,
for my web service requests, I setup CookieContainers which is supported under the compact framework.
Hopefully, I can clean it up so it runs unaltered with the compact framework.
