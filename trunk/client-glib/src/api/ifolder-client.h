 * 
 * iFolder is a simple and secure storage solution that can increase your
 * productivity by enabling you to back up, access and manage your personal
 * files-from anywhere, at any time. Once you have installed iFolder, you
 * simply save your files locally-as you have always done-and iFolder
 * automatically updates the files on a network server and delivers them to the
 * other machines you use.
 * 
 * A wiki page is maintained for iFolder at http://www.ifolder.com/
 * 
 * @section install_sec Installation
 * 
 * @subsection step1 Step 1: Get the Source Code

 * Get the source code from http://www.ifolder.com
