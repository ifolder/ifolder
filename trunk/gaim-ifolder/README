-----------
Background
-----------
iFolder3 (iFolder Denali) provides peer-to-peer filesharing in Workgroup Mode.
This means that you do not need an iFolder Server (which currently only runs on
Novell Open Enterprise Server) to be able to use iFolder.  The Gaim Workgroup
Domain project provides one implementation of iFolder Workgroup.

The Gaim Workgroup Domain consists of two parts:

1. Gaim Domain Thread Service
   - Runs with the iFolder/Simias process

2. Gaim iFolder Plugin
   - Runs as a plugin inside of Gaim (http://gaim.sourceforge.net/)



---------------------------------
Building the Gaim iFolder Plugin
---------------------------------

See the BUILDING file.


--------------
Prerequisites
--------------

You must have installed Simias and iFolder (http://www.ifolder.com)

Make sure you've enabled the Gaim Domain by editing "simias-client-bootstrap.config"
before you run simias for the first time.  Once you've run it, the file is
named "Simias.config".  The following line should exist in the file:

<Service name="Gaim Domain" assembly="Simias.Gaim.dll" enabled="True" type="Thread" class="Simias.Gaim.GaimService" />


--------------------------------------
Using/Testing the Gaim iFolder Plugin
--------------------------------------


Once you've enabled the plugin, you'll be able to simulate adding a member to
an iFolder.  Normally, once we plug in the calls to iFolder/Simias, an
invitation to share an iFolder will be sent to a buddy automatically when you
add the buddy as a member of an iFolder.

To simulate adding a buddy as an iFolder member, right-click on the buddy in
the Gaim Buddy List and select "Simulate Add Member".  It will prompt you for
a collection name and collection type (eventually you'll be able to share any
Simias collection types, like Glyphmarks, etc.).  When you press OK, an
invitation to share that collection will be sent to the buddy.  If the buddy
also has the Gaim iFolder Plugin installed, they'll be able to Accept/Reject
the invitation (and you'll see that when they do).

To bring up a list of pending invitations (incoming or outgoing), you can
right-click on a buddy in the buddy list and select "Simias Invitations" or
you can press the "Show Invitations" button on the iFolder plugin preferences
page.

Note: It might be easy to annoy buddies who do not have this plugin installed
by sending them invitations (since they'll see a message asking them to install
the plugin.  Either don't do this, or help them get the plugin installed too so
you can both join in on the fun.
