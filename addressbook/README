The AddressBook is a project started because the iFolder project needed an
AddressBook.  The specifications for a "Common Addressbook" were not being
met so the iFolder team wrote an Address Book to the specifications that were
given in the "Common AddressBook" spec. AddressBook is free software, licensed 
under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
(see the COPYING file).

--------------------
Building AddressBook
--------------------

	AddressBook is built on the Simias technology also maintained in the 
	iFolder project space. You may obtain Simias by visiting the iFolder
	Project website.

Linux
------
	You will need to have mono and gtk-sharp installed and working.  You can 
	get those from the Ximian Red Carpet server or http://www.go-mono.com

	To compile is the traditional:
		configure
		make
		make install

Win32
------
	You will need to have the following installed and working on your machine.
	(note that cygwin is not used on windows, nor is it tested)
	- .Net framework compiler and libraries
	- Perl (to run the configure script)
	- gnu make

	To compile is the traditional:
		configure
		make
		make install

OS X
------
	We are working to get AddressBook working on OS X. Right now there are some 
	issues to large to cover here.  Once you do get mono going on OS X, the
	Simias project should work much like it does on Linux.

	To compile is the traditional:
		configure
		make
		make install
