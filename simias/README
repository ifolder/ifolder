Building Simias
----------------

Linux
------
    Tested platforms:
        SuSE Linux 9 with Ximian Desktop 2 (XD2)
        Red Hat Linux 9 with XD2
      
    You will need to have the following installed and working on your machine:
     
    - mono 0.31 (or later)
    - gtk-sharp 0.17 (or later)
    
    You can get mono and gtk-sharp from http://www.go-mono.com or Ximian Red
    Carpet.
    
    - automake 1.7 (or later)
    - autoconf 2.57 (or later)
    - m4 1.40 (or later)
       
Win32
------
    Tested platforms:
        Windows XP Professional
        Windows 2000 Professional
    
    You will need to have the following installed and working on your machine:
    
    - Microsoft Visual Studio .NET
    
        We currently rely on the csc and cl compilers from Visual Studio .NET.
        The MSI and MSM packages are also built using Visual Studio .NET.
        We hope to migrate soon to a Windows build environment that only
        requires the .NET Framework SDK, not Visual Studio .NET.
    
    - Cygwin
    
        We recommend installing the following packages in addition to the
        default packages:
        
        Devel: autoconf, automake, libtool, make, pkgconfig, cvs, gcc, gcc-g++
        Editors: vim
        Net: openssh, openssl
        Text: more
        Utils: clear
        
        If your Windows environment is not set up to find the Visual Studio
        .NET tools, add the following line to cygwin.bat somewhere before it
        starts up the bash shell:
        
        call "%VS71COMNTOOLS%\vsvars32.bat" > NUL

OS X
-----
    We are working to get Simias working on OS X.  Right now there are some 
    issues too large to cover here.  Once you do get mono going on OS X, the
    Simias project should work much like it does on Linux.
