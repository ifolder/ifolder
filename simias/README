Building Simias
----------------

Linux
------
	You will need to have mono and gtk-sharp installed and working.  You can 
	get those from the Ximian Red Carpet server or http://www.go-mono.com

	To compile is the traditional:
		configure
		make
		make install

Win32
------
	You will need to have the following installed and working on your machine.
	(note that cygwin is not used on windows, nor is it tested)
	- .Net framework compiler and libraries
	- Perl (to run the configure script)
	- gnu make

	To compile is the traditional:
		configure
		make
		make install

OS X
------
	We are working to get Simias working on OS X.  Right now there are some 
	issues to large to cover here.  Once you do get mono going on OS X, the
	Simias project should work much like it does on Linux.

	To compile is the traditional:
		configure
		make
		make install
