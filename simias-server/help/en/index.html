You can log in again to resume working without closing your browser.</p><p>Log 
out by clicking Logout in the upper right header area, then close your 
browser. If you do not log out, your session remains open until your

in the current account. Available iFolders include those you own and 
those others have shared with you. You can access shared iFolders through 
Web access even if you have not set up the iFolder on a local computer.
