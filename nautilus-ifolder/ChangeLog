2004-12-10 20:00  btimothy

	* Makefile.am (1.6):

	Added code to allow us to automatically generate
	nautilus-ifolder/ChangeLog and nautilus-ifolder/po/ChangeLog by
	typing "make ChangeLog".

2004-12-10 19:34  btimothy

	* external/cvs2cl/: cvs2cl.pl (1.1), usermap.txt (1.1):

	Added cvs2cl which is a tool to convert cvs commit messages to GNU-style
	ChangeLogs.  "make ChangeLog" should be run manually as we make a
	release to update the ChangeLog file(s).

2004-12-10 19:02  btimothy

	* po/ChangeLog (1.1):

	Initial version

2004-12-10 18:47  btimothy

	* configure.in (1.14):

	Updated the po/*.po files to contain the strings which need translating.

2004-12-10 18:17  btimothy

	* po/.cvsignore (1.2), po/Makefile.am (1.2), Makefile.am (1.5),
	  autogen.sh (1.3), configure.in (1.13):

	Changed autogen.sh to use gnome-autogen.sh which automatically sets
	up things to do localization.

	Also modified Makefile.am and configure.in to start building the po/
	directory for localized strings.  It's not all the way finished yet, but
	closer.

2004-12-10 16:22  btimothy

	* configure.in (1.12):

	Changed the version stuff around to be more like iFolder.

2004-12-10 16:03  btimothy

	* src/: nautilus-ifolder.h.in (1.2), nautilus-ifolder.in (1.2):

	Changed @libdir@ to @prefix@/lib to see if it will fix the problem James
	is having building the RPM.

2004-12-10 00:14  btimothy

	* src/Makefile.am (1.12):

	Added code which makes sure that nautilus-ifolder.h is not added to the
	dist tar.gz.  nautilus-ifolder.h is generated from nautilus-ifolder.h.in.

2004-12-09 23:29  jjbell

	* configure.in (1.11):

	set PKG_CONFIG_DIR = 'lib'

2004-12-09 22:08  jjbell

	* configure.in (1.10):

	added $prefix/llib/pkgconfig to PKG_CONFIG_PATH

2004-12-08 19:40  btimothy

	* src/nautilus-ifolder.c (1.35):

	Added a call to sec_set_filter () so that we only get SimiasNodeEvents on
	Collections (iFolders).

2004-12-08 17:13  btimothy

	* src/nautilus-ifolder.c (1.34):

	We don't need to check the client state befre calling sec_deregister.  That
	check is done internally.  And the call to check the client state is being
	removed from the API.

2004-12-07 18:22  btimothy

	* src/nautilus-ifolder.c (1.33):

	Added the ability to disable debug messages (disabled by default).

2004-12-06 23:33  btimothy

	* src/nautilus-ifolder.c (1.32):

	Added a call to gnome_vfs_get_uri_from_local_path () inside
	slist_invalidate_local_path () which adds an emblem to an iFolder if
	nautilus is already running at the time iFolder is started.  This fix is
	needed to make directories with spaces or other special characters work
	properly.

2004-12-06 23:27  btimothy

	* src/nautilus-ifolder.c (1.31):

	Fixed a problem inside get_all_ifolder_paths () which was causing
	nautilus to segv.  The code now only returns paths for ifolders which
	have an unmanaged path (they are setup on the local box...which are the
	ones nautilus is interested in).

2004-12-06 23:15  btimothy

	* src/nautilus-ifolder.c (1.30):

	Added code that uses a couple functions from
	<libgnomevfs/gnome-vfs-utils.h> so that folders with spaces or other
	characters which normally get escaped in a URI will be unescaped before
	making calls to iFolder (via gSOAP).

2004-12-06 21:56  btimothy

	* src/nautilus-ifolder.c (1.29):

	Fixed the problem of get_all_ifolder_paths () returning a list of Simias
	IDs and not a list of unmanaged paths.

2004-12-06 21:43  btimothy

	* src/nautilus-ifolder.c (1.28):

	Fixed a problem in ht_invalidate_ifolder () where file_uri was never being
	initialized and was causing nautilus to blow chunks.  Also fixed references
	to the file_uri that is stored in seen_nautilus_ht (GHashTable) to be a
	gchar * instead of a char *.

2004-12-03 19:04  btimothy

	* src/nautilus-ifolder.c (1.27):

	Removed the hashtable that stores ALL folders that are seen and
	replaced it with a call to get all iFolders on a CONNECTED event and to
	iterate through the seen_ifolders_ht on DISCONNECTED.  This isn't fully
	tested because simias & iFolder are in a weird bad state (build issues).

2004-12-03 18:52  btimothy

	* external/ifolder/iFolderWebService.wsdl (1.3):

	Updated to the version of the WSDL as of 12/3/2004.

2004-12-02 23:31  btimothy

	* src/nautilus-ifolder.c (1.26):

	Added code to invalidate all existing NautilusFileInfo's on a CONNECTED
	or DISCONNECTED message.

2004-12-02 21:18  btimothy

	* src/nautilus-ifolder.c (1.25):

	Changed the way that events are registered.  Instead of spawning a new
	thread, we just pass a callback function to sec_init () where we're notified
	when we're connected to the Simias Event Server.

2004-12-01 22:38  btimothy

	* src/Makefile.am (1.11):

	Changed the link so that libsimias-event is statically linked.  This
	will make it so that when nautilus loads the extension, there
	doesn't have to be any type of library path for libsimias-event.

	Also changed nautilus-ifolder.exe to be a dependency of this
	library with a proper automake variable: libnautilus_ifolder_la_DEPENDENCIES

2004-12-01 19:30  btimothy

	* src/nautilus-ifolder.c (1.24):

	Added seen_ifolders_ht (GHashTable) to keep track of the iFolders
	the extension sees so that when a delete event is received from
	the Simias Event Server, we can remove the iFolder emblem from
	the folder.

	I also removed the old named pipe stuff now that we have the
	event client fully plugged-in.

2004-12-01 17:47  btimothy

	* src/Makefile.am (1.10), src/nautilus-ifolder.c (1.23),
	  configure.in (1.9), po/.cvsignore (1.1):

	Added an initial implementation that uses libsimias-event.  New
	iFolders that are created with the iFolder client will now be
	shown with a new emblem in any open Nautilus window showing
	the folder.

2004-11-30 16:13  btimothy

	* po/: Makefile.am (1.1), POTFILES.in (1.1), POTFILES.skip (1.1):

	Initial version (not working)...just stubbed here.

2004-11-23 13:39  btimothy

	* src/nautilus-ifolder.c (1.22):

	Added a return value to a function called by g_idle_add () to prevent the
	case of it being called over and over.

2004-11-22 23:16  btimothy

	* src/nautilus-ifolder.c (1.21):

	Removed code to keep track of NautilusFileInfo since we can just
	extern nautilus_file_get_existing () until this private API is
	exposed into the nautilus extension API.  This API will likely be
	exposed in the public API in nautilus 2.10+ (I'm guessing).

2004-11-22 18:00  btimothy

	* src/nautilus-ifolder.c (1.20):

	Added a call that can be called by the event service to invalidate
	a NautilusFileInfo and cause the emblem to appear/disappear.

	Also added a temporary named pipe for debug/testing purposes
	until the real event service is ready as a c library.

2004-11-22 15:12  btimothy

	* src/nautilus-ifolder.c (1.19):

	Added code to keep track of the NautilusFileInfo * the code sees
	so that we'll be able to invalidate the information we provided to
	Nautilus when a user changes a folder's status from the normal
	iFolder client.  Eventually, a new call will be added into Nautilus
	so we won't have to do this.

2004-11-19 17:15  btimothy

	* src/nautilus-ifolder.c (1.18):

	Added error messages that will show up to the end user where
	it's appropriate.

2004-11-19 15:01  btimothy

	* src/nautilus-ifolder.c (1.17):

	Removed unnecessary use of storing an attribute on a file

2004-11-19 14:36  btimothy

	* src/nautilus-ifolder.c (1.16):

	Added code to prevent iFolder context menus from appearing if
	the iFolder client is not running.

2004-11-19 14:26  btimothy

	* src/nautilus-ifolder.c (1.15):

	Changed the context menus and icons based on Trent's feedback

2004-11-19 01:04  btimothy

	* configure.in (1.8):

	Added the EEL dependency back in so that we can popup dialog
	boxes.

2004-11-19 01:04  btimothy

	* src/nautilus-ifolder.c (1.14):

	Added a function to tell whether iFolder is running or not.

	Also added code to use EEL to popup a confirmation dialog box
	when reverting an iFolder.  Also added code to be able to popup
	error messages to the user and cause the dialog to be modal on
	the nautilus window.  All the error messages are not integrated,
	but the capability is there and works.

2004-11-18 21:46  btimothy

	* configure.in (1.7):

	Added a line so Automake will generate the correct nautilus-ifolder.spec file

2004-11-18 01:14  btimothy

	* src/nautilus-ifolder.cs (1.6):

	Changed the confirmation dialog to use the localized strings
	instead of hardcoding them.

2004-11-17 23:48  btimothy

	* src/: nautilus-ifolder.c (1.13), nautilus-ifolder.cs (1.5):

	Added code to allow the extension to bring up the help file.

2004-11-17 21:39  btimothy

	* package/nautilus-ifolder.spec.in (1.2):

	Added variables so that we install the nautilus-ifolder.exe and
	the script file to the $prefix/lib and the other stuff into
	/opt/gnome where nautilus will pick it up.

2004-11-17 21:37  btimothy

	* src/Makefile.am (1.9):

	Fixed up the install paths so that the RPM builds correctly.

2004-11-17 20:56  btimothy

	* Makefile.am (1.4):

	Fixed the ability to call "make package" from the root of the project.

2004-11-17 20:05  btimothy

	* package/: nautilus-ifolder.spec (1.3), nautilus-ifolder.spec.in
	  (1.1):

	Changed nautilus-ifolder.spec to be generated by
	nautilus-ifolder.spec.in so that the package and version strings
	can be configured as an autoconf variable in ../configure.in.

2004-11-17 20:01  btimothy

	* package/nautilus-ifolder.spec (1.2):

	Updated the file so that it will package the correct files.

2004-11-17 20:00  btimothy

	* src/Makefile.am (1.8):

	Modified the file so that the nautilus-ifolder RPM can be built.

2004-11-17 18:30  btimothy

	* src/nautilus-ifolder.c (1.12):

	Added two functions: "init_gsoap()" and "cleanup_gsoap()" and
	made it so that every function that makes calls to gsoap creates
	their own gsoap structure.  This prevents problems with the
	multi-threading that I added yesterday.

2004-11-16 23:59  btimothy

	* Makefile.am (1.3):

	Added code to handle "make dist" and hopefully packaging an
	RPM as well.

2004-11-16 23:59  btimothy

	* configure.in (1.6):

	Removed the "maximum" compile warnings since it prevented
	the build from running on someone else's box.  Also, added
	package/Makefile to be built.

2004-11-16 23:57  btimothy

	* package/: Makefile.am (1.1), nautilus-ifolder.spec (1.1):

	initial version

2004-11-16 23:57  btimothy

	* src/Makefile.am (1.7):

	Added information for 'make dist' to work correctly.

2004-11-16 21:52  btimothy

	* configure.in (1.5):

	Removed EEL dependency

2004-11-16 21:43  btimothy

	* NEWS (1.1):

	initial version

2004-11-16 21:00  btimothy

	* src/: Makefile.am (1.6), ifolder-folder.png (1.1),
	  nautilus-ifolder.c (1.11):

	Added ifolder-folder.png to be used as the icon that appears to
	the left of the menu item in the context-menu.  Files affected:
	ifolder-folder.png, Makefile.am, nautilus-ifolder.c

2004-11-16 20:58  btimothy

	* external/ifolder/iFolderWebService.wsdl (1.2):

	Removed my machine's specific Web Service URL.

2004-11-16 20:35  btimothy

	* src/nautilus-ifolder.c (1.10):

	Implemented revert_ifolder_callback.  Also renamed the
	ifolder_propdialog_thread to ifolder_dialog_thread so it could be
	reused by all functions needing to open a dialog.

2004-11-16 20:33  btimothy

	* src/nautilus-ifolder.cs (1.4):

	Added an implementation for confirmRevertiFolder ().

2004-11-16 19:58  btimothy

	* src/nautilus-ifolder.cs (1.3):

	Added Application.Init () at the beginning of the Main () function
	so that Gtk is initialized for the properties dialog to be shown.

2004-11-16 19:57  btimothy

	* src/nautilus-ifolder.c (1.9):

	Added pthread_create () calls so that any calls made to the
	iFolder Client or nautilus-ifolder.exe will not block the Nautilus UI.
	Without doing this, the Nautilus UI feels sluggish when selecting
	the iFolder context menu items.

2004-11-16 18:48  btimothy

	* configure.in (1.4), src/Makefile.am (1.5), src/nautilus-ifolder.c
	  (1.8), src/nautilus-ifolder.cs (1.2), src/nautilus-ifolder.h.in
	  (1.1), src/nautilus-ifolder.in (1.1):

	Fixed up the autotools so that we do a little bit better guessing
	as to where things are installed.  Also, the .NET exe file is now
	being built and installed.  This will eventually allow the iFolder
	properties dialog to show up (it's not currently working).

2004-11-15 23:53  btimothy

	* configure.in (1.3), src/Makefile.am (1.4), src/nautilus-ifolder.c
	  (1.7), src/nautilus-ifolder.cs (1.1):

	Added nautilus-ifolder.cs so that we can call iFolder .NET code to
	get configuration information (i.e., the Web Service URL) and also
	be able to display dialog boxes.

2004-11-15 16:47  btimothy

	* src/nautilus-ifolder.c (1.6):

	Added a custom URL to the soap_call () functions.  The URL still
	needs to be dynamically determined at module initialization.

2004-11-15 15:24  btimothy

	* external/ifolder/iFolderWebService.wsdl (1.1),
	  src/nautilus-ifolder.c (1.5), src/stdsoap2.c (1.1),
	  src/stdsoap2.h (1.1), src/Makefile.am (1.3):

	Added code to call the iFolder Web Service using gSOAP.
