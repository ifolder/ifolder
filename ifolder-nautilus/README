Building iFolder
----------------

    iFolder is built on two other technologies also maintained in the iFolder
    project space.  These two other technolgies are Simias and the iFolder
    AddressBook.  You may obtain these technologies by visiting the iFolder
    Project website.
        
    You will need to configure and install Simias and the iFolder AddressBook
    before building iFolder.  We recommend they all be configured to use the
    same install prefix.  If not, when you configure iFolder you must specify
    where the Simias and iFolder AddressBook projects are installed using
    --with-simias-install-path and --with-addressbook-install-path,
    respectively.  These assemblies must all currently reside in the same
    directory.  Eventually they will be strongly named and installed in the
    Global Assembly Cache (GAC).

Linux
------
    Tested platforms:
        SuSE Linux 9 with Ximian Desktop 2 (XD2)
        Red Hat Linux 9 with XD2
      
    You will need to have the following installed and working on your machine:
     
    - mono 0.31 (or later)
    - gtk-sharp 0.17 (or later)
    
    You can get mono and gtk-sharp from http://www.go-mono.com or Ximian Red
    Carpet.
       
    - automake 1.7 (or later)
    - autoconf 2.57 (or later)
    - m4 1.40 (or later)
       
    We are working on integrating iFolder into Nautilus (see
    src/iFolderNautilus).  This currently requires the Ximian Desktop
    unstable build and must be built separately.  This will be included
    in the standard build once things are a little more stable.

Win32
------
    Tested platforms:
        Windows XP Professional
        Windows 2000 Professional
    
    You will need to have the following installed and working on your machine:
    
    - Microsoft Visual Studio .NET
    
        We currently rely on the csc and cl compilers from Visual Studio .NET.
        The MSI and MSM packages are also built using Visual Studio .NET.
        We hope to migrate soon to a Windows build environment that only
        requires the .NET Framework SDK, not Visual Studio .NET.
    
    - Cygwin
    
        We recommend installing the following packages in addition to the
        default packages:
        
        Devel: autoconf, automake, libtool, make, pkgconfig, cvs, gcc, gcc-g++
        Editors: vim
        Net: openssh, openssl
        Text: more
        Utils: clear
        
        If your Windows environment is not set up to find the Visual Studio
        .NET tools, add the following line to cygwin.bat somewhere before it
        starts up the bash shell:
        
        call "%VS71COMNTOOLS%\vsvars32.bat" > NUL

OS X
-----
    We are working to get iFolder working on OS X.  Right now there are some 
    issues too large to cover here.  Once you do get mono going on OS X, the
    Simias project should work much like it does on Linux.

All Platforms
--------------
    To compile from a source distribution:
        ./configure --prefix=<install_path>
        make
        make install
    
    To compile source from CVS:
        ./autogen.sh --prefix=<install_path>
        make
        make install
