<div class="Topic" title="Deleting an iFolder Account">

<h2 class="TOPIC-TITLE"><br />Deleting an iFolder Account</h2>
<p class="TOPIC">You can specify whether to remove the account only from the current computer or whether to also remove the iFolders you own from the server, essentially stopping the shared iFolders you have set up for that account. </p>
<p class="TOPIC">If you remove an iFolder account from your computer, the related local copies of iFolders are reverted to normal folders. You can continue to access the iFolders from other computers or the Web.</p>
<p class="TOPIC">If you remove your iFolder account from the server: </p>
<ul class="LISTBULLET">
<li class="BULLETITEM">All of the iFolders you own are unshared.</li>

<li class="BULLETITEM">The local copies of iFolders on member computers are reverted to normal folders.</li>

<li class="BULLETITEM">The iFolder and its contents are removed from the server.</li>

<li class="BULLETITEM">You are removed as a member of iFolders that others shared with you.</li>
</ul>
<ol class="STEPLIST">
<li class="STEP"><a name="bvwspv2"></a>
<p class="STEP">Right-click the iFolder application icon <img src="../graphics/ifolder16.png" alt="iFolder Startup Icon" /> in the Notification area, then select Accounts to open the iFolder Preferences dialog box to the Accounts tab.</p></li>

<li class="STEP"><a name="bvwspv3"></a>
<p class="STEP">Select the iFolder account you want to delete, then click Delete.</p></li>

<li class="STEP"><a name="bvwspqf"></a>
<p class="STEP">A message prompts you to determine the extent of the delete action. Do one of the following:</p>
<ul class="LISTBULLET">
<li class="BULLETITEM"><p class="PARAWITHTITLE"><a name="bvwsuhg"></a><em class="PARAWITHTITLE">Remove the iFolder Account from Only the Current Computer: </em>Deselect Remove My iFolder and Files from the Server, then click Yes. iFolder removes the selected account only from the local workstation. The local iFolders for this account are reverted to normal folders. Use a file manager to locate and delete the local copy of the data if it is not needed. </p>
<p class="BULLETITEM">You can continue to access your iFolders for this account from other computers with the iFolder client. When the iFolder client is used with a Novell<sup>&reg;</sup> iFolder<sup>&reg;</sup> 3.<em class="VERSIONVARIABLE">x</em> enterprise server, you can access files from anywhere with Novell iFolder 3.<em class="VERSIONVARIABLE">x</em> Web access.</p></li>

<li class="BULLETITEM"><p class="PARAWITHTITLE"><a name="bvwsxkq"></a><em class="PARAWITHTITLE">Remove the iFolder Account and Your iFolders and Files from the Server: </em>Select Remove My iFolder and Files from the Server, then click Yes. iFolder removes the selected account from the local workstation. It also removes all iFolders you own for this account from the server and reverts the iFolders to normal folders on the current computer and all member computers. Finally, this removes you as a member in shared iFolders on this account. The local iFolders are all reverted to normal folders. Use a file manager to locate and delete the local copy of the data if it is not needed.</p>
<p class="BULLETITEM">If you decide to use this account again on this or another computer, you must set up the account and its iFolders just as you did when it was new.</p></li>

<li class="BULLETITEM"><p class="PARAWITHTITLE"><a name="bvwsxkr"></a><em class="PARAWITHTITLE">Cancel the Delete: </em>Click No to back out of the delete action. Your account and its iFolders remain untouched.</p></li>
</ul></li>
