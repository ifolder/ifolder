<BR><H2 CLASS="TOPIC-TITLE">Benefits of iFolder</H2>
<P CLASS="TOPIC">When working in multiple locations or in collaboration with others, you must conscientiously manage file versions. With iFolder, the most recent version of your files can follow you to any computer where you have installed the iFolder client set up the shared iFolder. iFolder also allows you to share multiple iFolders and their separate content with other authorized users. You decide who participates in each iFolder's workgroup and their level of access. Similarly, you can participate in shared iFolders that are hosted by others in your collaboration environment.</P>
<P CLASS="TOPIC">The iFolder client synchronizes the most recent version of documents to all authorized users of your shared iFolder. All that you and other iFolder members need is an active network connection and the iFolder client. With an enterprise server, your iFolders are stored centrally for all iFolder members. In a workgroup solution, your workstation acts as a host for other users of your shared iFolder, your computer must also be active for synchronization to occur. </P>
