<div class="Topic" title="Benefits of iFolder">

<h2 class="TOPIC-TITLE"><br />Benefits of iFolder</h2>
<p class="TOPIC">When working in multiple locations or in collaboration with others, you must conscientiously manage file versions. With iFolder, the most recent version of your files can follow you to any computer where you have installed the iFolder client and set up the shared iFolder. iFolder also allows you to share multiple iFolders and their separate content with other authorized users. You decide who participates in each iFolder's workgroup and their level of access. Similarly, you can participate in shared iFolders that are hosted by others in your collaboration environment.</p>
<p class="TOPIC">The iFolder client synchronizes the most recent version of documents to all authorized users of your shared iFolder. All that you and other iFolder members need is an active network connection and the iFolder client. With an enterprise server, your iFolders are stored centrally for all iFolder members. In a workgroup solution, your workstation acts as a host for other users of your shared iFolder, your computer must also be active for synchronization to occur. </p>
<p class="TOPIC">iFolder provides the following benefits:</p>
<ul class="LISTBULLET">
<li class="BULLETITEM">Integrates with your native desktop environment, making it easy to create and manage multiple iFolders.</li>

<li class="BULLETITEM">Is highly scalable and flexible, with no practical limit on the number of iFolders per workstation or on the number of members per iFolder workgroup.</li>

<li class="BULLETITEM">Allows you to host iFolders locally and invite members, including yourself, so that your iFolder files are available from any member's workstation where the iFolder client is installed and where a membership in the shared iFolder is active.</li>

<li class="BULLETITEM">Allows you to easily and selectively share personal and business files with anyone.</li>

<li class="BULLETITEM">Allows you to control the access level of users who share your iFolders.</li>

<li class="BULLETITEM">Guards against local data loss by automatically saving the most recent version of your local files to the shared iFolder on multiple workstations.</li>

<li class="BULLETITEM">Transparently updates your files to the primary iFolder and member iFolders on multiple workstations.</li>

<li class="BULLETITEM">Tracks and logs changes made while you work offline, and synchronizes those changes when you go online.</li>

<li class="BULLETITEM">Provides secure RSA authentication of member iFolders to exchange data with the primary iFolder.</li>

<li class="BULLETITEM">Is available for free download to everyone because it is open source software.</li>

<li class="BULLETITEM">Offers an alternative to exchanging files via e-mail, which avoids the file-size limits on e-mail attachments and reduces your e-mail storage requirements.</li>
</ul>
