iFolder</h2>

<p class="para">Before you begin to use iFolder, it is important to understand
the following key features:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul class="listbullet">
<li class="listitem"><a href="keyfeatures.html#b9425t8">Section 1.3.1, The iFolder Client </a></li>

<div class="sect2" title="The iFolder Client " id="b9425t8">

<h3 class="title"><span class="number">1.3.1</span> The iFolder Client </h3>

<p class="para">The iFolder client integrates with your operating system to
provide iFolder services in your native desktop environment. The
iFolder client allows you to manage your own iFolders and to select which
shared iFolders to set up on each computer. iFolder supports the
following operating systems:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul class="listbullet">
<li class="listitem">SUSE® Linux Enterprise Desktop
10 </li>
<li class="listitem">Windows 2000/XP/2003</li>
<li class="listitem">Open SUSE 10.2 and later</li></ul></div>

</div>

<div class="sect2" title="iFolder Account" id="b9425t9">

<h3 class="title"><span class="number">1.3.2</span> iFolder Account</h3>

<p class="para">You must configure at least one iFolder account before you
can create iFolders. An iFolder account is created when an iFolder
services administrator provisions you as an iFolder user for an
iFolder server. The administrator provides you with a username and
password. For an enterprise, this might be your username or e-mail
address and the related password.</p>
<p class="para">An iFolder session begins when you log in to an iFolder services
account and ends when you log out, or when you exit the iFolder
client. Your iFolders synchronize files with other active iFolders only
when your session is active and you are working online. You can
access data in your local iFolders at any time, whether you are
logged in to the account, or not. For information, see <a href="accounts.html#accounts">Section 3.3, Configuring an iFolder
Account</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect2" title="Improved Shared iFolders" id="b9425ta">

<h3 class="title"><span class="number">1.3.3</span> Improved Shared iFolders</h3>

<p class="para">An iFolder is a local directory that selectively shares and
synchronizes files via a central server with a user-specified group
of users. The iFolder files are accessible to all iFolder members
and can be changed by those with the rights to do so. You can access
your iFolders across multiple workstations and share them with others.</p>
<p class="para">You work with iFolders directly in your file manager or in
the iFolder browser that is part of the client. Within the iFolder,
you can set up any subdirectory structure that suits your personal
or corporate work habits. The subdirectory structure is constant
across all member iFolders. When you share an iFolder, member users
with the Write permission can modify the directory structure, and those
changes apply to all copies of the iFolder. Each user can locate
the shared iFolder anywhere on his or her own computer if it satisfies
the <a href="locguide.html#locguide">Section 4.1, Guidelines for the
Location and Use of iFolders</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect2" title="iFolder Access Rights" id="b9425tb">

<h3 class="title"><span class="number">1.3.4</span> iFolder Access Rights</h3>

<p class="para">The iFolder client supports the owner and three levels of
access for members of an iFolder: </p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul class="listbullet">
<li class="listitem">
<div class="formalpara" id="b9425tc"><p class="title"><em class="title">Owner:</em>
Only one user serves as the owner of an iFolder. This is typically
the user who creates the iFolder. The owner user can use the iFolder
client to transfer ownership to another member of the iFolder. </p></div>

<p class="listitem">The owner of an iFolder has the Full Control right. This user
has read/write access to the iFolder, manages membership
and access rights for member users, and can remove the Full Control
right for any member.</p></li>
<li class="listitem">
<div class="formalpara" id="b9425td"><p class="title"><em class="title">Full Control:</em>
A member of the shared iFolder, with the Full Control access
right. This member has read/write access to the iFolder
and manages membership and access rights for all users except the
owner. </p></div>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<div class="formalpara" id="b9425te"><p class="title"><em class="title">Read/Write:</em>
A member of the shared iFolder, with the Read/Write
access right to the directories and files in the iFolder. This member
can modify a file, but the local changes are  synchronized to other
members’ copies of the iFolder. </p></div>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<div class="formalpara" id="b9425tf"><p class="title"><em class="title">Read Only:</em>
A member of the shared iFolder, with the Read Only access
right to directories and files in the iFolder. This member can modify
a file, but the local changes are not synchronized to other members’ copies
of the iFolder.</p></div>
</li></ul></div>

<p class="para">Any iFolder user can own some iFolders and be a member of
other iFolders. As an owner user, you always have the Full Control
right. As a member user, your level of access in each shared iFolder can
differ, depending on the access granted to you by any member with
the Full Control right.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect2" title="File Synchronization and Data Management" id="b9425tg">

<h3 class="title"><span class="number">1.3.5</span> File Synchronization and Data Management</h3>

<p class="para">When you set up an iFolder account, you can enable <span class="guimenu">Remember
My Password</span> so that iFolder can synchronize iFolder membership
and files in the background as you work. </p>
<p class="para">You can configure the iFolder client to run automatically
each time you log in to your computer’s desktop environment.
The session runs in the background as you work with files in your
local iFolders, tracking and logging any changes you make. </p>
<p class="para">You can synchronize the files at specified intervals or on
demand.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect2" title="Encryption" id="b7x5io1">

<h3 class="title"><span class="number">1.3.6</span> Encryption</h3>

<p class="para">iFolder 3.6 provides higher security for your confidential
iFolder files, to protect them from intentional or unintentional
access by unauthorized people. In the past, data security was not
ensured on the server side, so the data was accessible to the administrator
or to anyone who gained unauthorized access to the server. In addition
when you access iFolder files via an ISP provider, there is a chance
that an unauthorized individual can inadvertently stumble across
your confidential files.  Now, you can encrypt and save your files
on on the server, and retrieve them  through a passphrase known
only to you. If you forget your passphrase, the recovery agent you
have selected during the creation of the encrypted iFolder helps
you recover your data. For more information on encryption, see <a href="managingpassphrse.html#managingpassphrse">Managing Passphrase for Encrypted iFolders</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect2" title="Enhanced Web Access" id="b7x6cp3">

<h3 class="title"><span class="number">1.3.7</span> Enhanced Web Access</h3>

<p class="para">iFolder 3.6 provides an enhanced Web interface that allows
you to access your iFolder files on remote servers. With the enhanced
Web Access console, you can use a Web browser to access your files
on the iFolder server from any workstation without the iFolder client.
The  Web Access client enables you to perform all the  operations
of  the iFolder client. You can create, browse, share, and delete
iFolders,  and upload files via the Web access console. Mobile users
can also make use of this facility through the Web.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect2" title="Synchronization Log" id="b9425th">

<h3 class="title"><span class="number">1.3.8</span> Synchronization Log</h3>

<p class="para">The synchronization log displays a log of your iFolder background
activity, such as uploading and downloading files for different
iFolders. </p>
