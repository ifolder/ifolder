<div class="Topic" title="Key Features of iFolder">

<h2 class="TOPIC-TITLE"><br />Key Features of iFolder</h2>
<p class="TOPIC">Before you begin to use iFolder, it is important to understand the following key features:</p>
<ul class="LISTBULLET">
<li class="BULLETITEM"><a href="bq1r110.html#bq1r111">The iFolder Client </a></li>

<li class="BULLETITEM"><a href="bq1r110.html#bq1r112">Shared iFolders</a></li>

<li class="BULLETITEM"><a href="bq1r110.html#bq1r113">iFolder Access Rights</a></li>

<li class="BULLETITEM"><a href="bq1r110.html#bq655zc">Account Setup for Enterprise Servers</a></li>

<li class="BULLETITEM"><a href="bq1r110.html#bq5xp9r">Access Authentication</a></li>

<li class="BULLETITEM"><a href="bq1r110.html#bq1r118">File Synchronization and Data Management</a></li>

<li class="BULLETITEM"><a href="bq1r110.html#bq63xvh">Synchronization Log</a></li>
</ul>
<div class="Head" title="The iFolder Client ">
<a name="bq1r111"></a>

<h3 class="HEAD-TITLE"><br />The iFolder Client </h3>
<p class="HEAD">The iFolder client integrates with your operating system to provide iFolder services in your native desktop environment. iFolder supports the following operating systems:</p>
<ul class="LISTBULLET">
<li class="BULLETITEM">Novell Linux Desktop 9</li>

<li class="BULLETITEM">Windows 2000/XP</li>

<li class="BULLETITEM">Macintosh OS X v10.3 or later</li>
</ul>
<p class="HEAD">An iFolder session begins when you log in to an iFolder services account and ends when you log out, or when you exit the iFolder client. Your iFolders synchronize files with other active iFolders only when your session is active and you are working online. You can access data in your local iFolders at any time, whether you are logged in to the account, or not.</p>
<p class="HEAD">The iFolder client allows users to manage their iFolders. For information, see <a href="myifolders.html#myifolders">Managing iFolders</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="Head" title="Shared iFolders">
<a name="bq1r112"></a>

<h3 class="HEAD-TITLE"><br />Shared iFolders</h3>
<p class="HEAD">An iFolder is a local directory that selectively shares and synchronizes files with a user-specified group of users. The iFolder files are accessible to all iFolder members and can be changed by those with the rights to do so. You can share iFolders across multiple workstations and with others.</p>
<p class="HEAD">You work with iFolders directly in your file manager or in My iFolders. Within the iFolder, you can set up any subdirectory structure that suits your personal or corporate work habits. The subdirectory structure is constant across all member iFolders. Each workstation can specify a different parent directory for the shared iFolder.</p>
</div>

<div class="Head" title="iFolder Access Rights">
<a name="bq1r113"></a>

<h3 class="HEAD-TITLE"><br />iFolder Access Rights</h3>
<p class="HEAD">The iFolder client supports the owner and three levels of access for members of an iFolder: </p>
<ul class="LISTBULLET">
<li class="BULLETITEM"><p class="PARAWITHTITLE"><a name="bq8voz4"></a><em class="PARAWITHTITLE">Owner: </em>Only one user serves as the owner of an iFolder. This is typically the user who created the iFolder. The owner user can use the iFolder client to transfer ownership to another member of the iFolder. The iFolder Admin user can transfer ownership to any user on the iFolder server, using administrator tools.</p>
<p class="BULLETITEM">The owner of an iFolder has the Full Control right. This user has read/write access to the iFolder, manages membership and access rights for member users, and can remove the Full Control right for any member. With an enterprise server, the disk space used by the owner's iFolders count against the owner's user disk quotas on the enterprise server. </p>
<p class="BULLETITEM">If a user is deleted as a user for the iFolder system, the iFolders owned by the user are orphaned. Orphaned iFolders are assigned temporarily to the iFolder Admin user as a custodian owner. Membership and synchronization continues while the iFolder Admin user determines whether an orphaned iFolder should be deleted or assigned to a new owner.</p></li>

<li class="BULLETITEM"><p class="PARAWITHTITLE"><a name="bq8voz5"></a><em class="PARAWITHTITLE">Full Control: </em>A member of the shared iFolder, with the Full Control access right. The user with the Full Control right has read/write access to the iFolder and manages membership and access rights for all users except the owner. </p></li>

<li class="BULLETITEM"><p class="PARAWITHTITLE"><a name="bq8voz6"></a><em class="PARAWITHTITLE">Read/Write: </em>A member of the shared iFolder, with the Read/Write access right to directories and files in the iFolder.</p></li>

<li class="BULLETITEM"><p class="PARAWITHTITLE"><a name="bq8voz7"></a><em class="PARAWITHTITLE">Read Only: </em>A member of the shared iFolder, with the Read Only access right to directories and files in the iFolder. This member modify the file but the local changes are not synchronized back to the server.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="HEAD">When used with an enterprise server account, the server hosts every iFolder created for that account. Users create an iFolder and the enterprise server makes it available to the specified list of users. A user can have a separate account on each enterprise server.</p>
<p class="HEAD">Any iFolder account holder can own some iFolders and be a member of other iFolders. Your level of access in each shared iFolder can differ, depending on the role you play and the access granted to you by any member with the Full Control right.</p>
</div>

<div class="Head" title="Account Setup for Enterprise Servers">
<a name="bq655zc"></a>

<h3 class="HEAD-TITLE"><br />Account Setup for Enterprise Servers</h3>
<p class="HEAD">The iFolder client allows you to set up multiple accounts across domains, where a domain is represented by a given enterprise server. You specify the server address, username, and password to uniquely identify an account. On your computer, you set up accounts while logged in as the local identity you plan to use to access that account and its iFolders. Under your local login, you can set up multiple iFolder accounts, but each account must belong to a different iFolder enterprise server.  </p>
</div>

<div class="Head" title="Access Authentication">
<a name="bq5xp9r"></a>

<h3 class="HEAD-TITLE"><br />Access Authentication</h3>
<p class="HEAD">Whenever iFolder connects to an enterprise server to synchronize files, it connects with HTTP or HTTPS (SSL) connections to the server, and the server authenticates the user against the domain's LDAP directory service. The administrator determines whether iFolder traffic uses HTTP or HTTPS connections.</p>
</div>

<div class="Head" title="File Synchronization and Data Management">
<a name="bq1r118"></a>

<h3 class="HEAD-TITLE"><br />File Synchronization and Data Management</h3>
<p class="HEAD">When you set up an iFolder account, you can enable Remember Password so that iFolder can synchronize iFolder invitations and files in the background as you work. </p>
<p class="HEAD">You can configure the iFolder client to run automatically each time you log in to your computer's desktop environment. The session runs in the background as you work with files in your local iFolders, tracking and logging any changes you make. </p>
<p class="HEAD">You can synchronize the files at specified intervals or on demand.</p>
</div>

<div class="Head" title="Synchronization Log">
<a name="bq63xvh"></a>

<h3 class="HEAD-TITLE"><br />Synchronization Log</h3>
<p class="HEAD">The log displays a log of your iFolder background activity. </p>
</div>
