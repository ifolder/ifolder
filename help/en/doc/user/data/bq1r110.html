<BR><H2 CLASS="TOPIC-TITLE">Key Features of iFolder</H2>
<P CLASS="TOPIC">Before you begin to use iFolder, it is important to understand the following key features:</P>
<UL CLASS="LISTBULLET">
<LI CLASS="BULLETITEM"><A href="bq1r110.html#bq1r111">The iFolder Client </A></LI>

<LI CLASS="BULLETITEM"><A href="bq1r110.html#bq1r112">Shared iFolders</A></LI>

</UL><P><A name="bq1r111"></A>

<BR><H3 CLASS="HEAD-TITLE">The iFolder Client </H3>
<P CLASS="HEAD">The iFolder client integrates with your operating system to provide iFolder services in your native desktop environment. iFolder supports the following operating systems:</P>
<UL CLASS="LISTBULLET">
<LI CLASS="BULLETITEM">Novell Linux Desktop 1.0</LI>

<LI CLASS="BULLETITEM">Windows 2000/XP</LI>

<LI CLASS="BULLETITEM">Macintosh</LI>
</UL><P>
<P CLASS="HEAD">An iFolder session begins when you log in to an iFolder services account and ends when you log out, or when you exit the iFolder client. Your iFolders synchronize files with other active iFolders only when your session is active and you are working online. You can access data in your local iFolders at any time, whether you are logged in to the account, or not.</P>
<P CLASS="HEAD">The iFolder client allows users to manage their iFolders. For information, see <A href="myifolders.html#myifolders">Managing iFolders</A>.</P><A name="bq1r112"></A>

<BR><H3 CLASS="HEAD-TITLE">Shared iFolders</H3>
<P CLASS="HEAD">An iFolder is a local directory that selectively shares and synchronizes files with a user-specified workgroup in a peer-to-peer sharing model. The iFolder files are accessible to all workgroup members and can be changed by those with the rights to do so. You can share iFolders across multiple workstations and with others.</P>
<P CLASS="HEAD">You work with iFolders directly in your file manager. Within the iFolder, you can set up any subdirectory structure that suits your personal or corporate work habits. The subdirectory structure is constant across all member iFolders. Each workstation can specify a different parent directory for the shared iFolder.</P><A name="bq1r113"></A>

<BR><H3 CLASS="HEAD-TITLE">iFolder Access Rights</H3>
<P CLASS="HEAD">The iFolder client provides an Advanced Properties page for an iFolder where you can make the iFolder available to other users and to specify access rights for each one. There are multiple levels of access rights for a shared iFolder:</P>
<UL CLASS="LISTBULLET">
<LI CLASS="BULLETITEM"><P CLASS="PARAWITHTITLE"><A name="bq8voz4"></A><EM CLASS="PARAWITHTITLE">Owner: </EM>The owner of the primary shared iFolder, with ownership and the Full Control right. The iFolder owner has read/write access to the iFolder, manages membership and access rights for users, and can remove the Full Control right for any member. The owner's computer is the host for the iFolder workgroup and must be active and online to synchronize files with member iFolders. With an enterprise server, the disk space used by the owner's iFolders count against the owner's iFolder disk quota for that account.</P>
<P CLASS="BULLETITEM">Only one user serves as the owner. This is typically the user that created the iFolder. The owner can transfer ownership status to another user.</P></LI>

<LI CLASS="BULLETITEM"><P CLASS="PARAWITHTITLE"><A name="bq8voz5"></A><EM CLASS="PARAWITHTITLE">Full Control: </EM>A member of the iFolder workgroup, with the Full Control access right. The user with the Full Control right has read/write access to the iFolder and manages membership and access rights for all users except the owner.</P>
<P CLASS="BULLETITEM">Multiple users can serve as Admin owners. An Admin owner can add and remove Full Control access rights only for other Admin owners, not the Bill owner. </P></LI>

<LI CLASS="BULLETITEM"><P CLASS="PARAWITHTITLE"><A name="bq8voz6"></A><EM CLASS="PARAWITHTITLE">Read/Write: </EM>A member of the iFolder workgroup, with the Read/Write access right to directories and files in the iFolder.</P></LI>

<LI CLASS="BULLETITEM"><P CLASS="PARAWITHTITLE"><A name="bq8voz7"></A><EM CLASS="PARAWITHTITLE">Read Only: </EM>A member of the iFolder workgroup, with the Read Only access right to directories and files in the iFolder.</P></LI>
</UL><P>
<P CLASS="HEAD">With an enterprise server, the server hosts every iFolder. Users create the iFolder and the enterprise server makes it available to the specified list of users you want to share it with.</P>
<P CLASS="HEAD">Any given workstation can be both a host and a client in the workgroup model. You can host multiple iFolders on your workstation and be a member of iFolder workgroups hosted by others. Your level of membership in each shared iFolder can differ.</P><A name="bq655zc"></A>

<BR><H3 CLASS="HEAD-TITLE">Account Set Up for Enterprise Servers</H3>
<P CLASS="HEAD">The iFolder client allows you to set up multiple accounts across domains. You specify the server address, username, and password to uniquely identify an account.</P><A name="bq5xp9r"></A>

<BR><H3 CLASS="HEAD-TITLE">Access Authentication</H3>
<P CLASS="HEAD">Whenever an iFolder connects to member iFolders in the workgroup to synchronize files, it authenticates with basic HTML and SSL connections.</P>
<P CLASS="HEAD">Whenever iFolder connects to an enterprise server to synchronize files, it connects with basic HTML and SSL connections to the server, and the server authenticates the user against the domain's LDAP directory service. </P><A name="bq1r118"></A>

<BR><H3 CLASS="HEAD-TITLE">File Synchronization and Data Management</H3>
<P CLASS="HEAD">An iFolder client runs automatically each time you log in to your computer's desktop environment. The session runs in the background as you work with files in your local iFolders, tracking and logging any changes you make. </P>
<P CLASS="HEAD">When synchronizing files in workgroup mode, the iFolder client performs the data exchange transparently with the appropriate primary iFolder or with other member iFolders, depending on the status of your workstation as a client or a host, respectively, for any given iFolder.</P><A name="bq63xvh"></A>

<BR><H3 CLASS="HEAD-TITLE">Sync Log</H3>
<P CLASS="HEAD">The log displays a log of your iFolder background activity. </P><BR><BR><script language="javascript" src="../../../ui/bottomnav.js"></script>
