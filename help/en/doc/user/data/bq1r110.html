<div class="Topic" title="Key Features of iFolder">

<h2 class="TOPIC-TITLE"><br />Key Features of iFolder</h2>
<p class="TOPIC">Before you begin to use iFolder, it is important to understand the following key features:</p>
<ul class="LISTBULLET">
<li class="BULLETITEM"><a href="bq1r110.html#bq1r111">The iFolder Client </a></li>

<li class="BULLETITEM"><a href="bq1r110.html#bq1r112">Shared iFolders</a></li>

<li class="BULLETITEM"><a href="bq1r110.html#bq1r113">iFolder Access Rights</a></li>

<li class="BULLETITEM"><a href="bq1r110.html#bq655zc">Account Setup for Enterprise Servers</a></li>

<li class="BULLETITEM"><a href="bq1r110.html#bq5xp9r">Access Authentication</a></li>

<li class="BULLETITEM"><a href="bq1r110.html#bq1r118">File Synchronization and Data Management</a></li>

<li class="BULLETITEM"><a href="bq1r110.html#bq63xvh">Synchronization Log</a></li>
</ul>
<div class="Head" title="The iFolder Client ">
<a name="bq1r111"></a>

<h3 class="HEAD-TITLE"><br />The iFolder Client </h3>
<p class="HEAD">The iFolder client integrates with your operating system to provide iFolder services in your native desktop environment. iFolder supports the following operating systems:</p>
<ul class="LISTBULLET">
<li class="BULLETITEM">Novell Linux Desktop 9</li>

<li class="BULLETITEM">Windows 2000/XP</li>

<li class="BULLETITEM">Macintosh OS X v10.3 or later</li>
</ul>
<p class="HEAD">An iFolder session begins when you log in to an iFolder services account and ends when you log out, or when you exit the iFolder client. Your iFolders synchronize files with other active iFolders only when your session is active and you are working online. You can access data in your local iFolders at any time, whether you are logged in to the account, or not.</p>
<p class="HEAD">The iFolder client allows you to manage your own iFolders and to select which shared iFolders to set up on each computer. For information, see <a href="myifolders.html#myifolders">Managing iFolders</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="Head" title="Shared iFolders">
<a name="bq1r112"></a>

<h3 class="HEAD-TITLE"><br />Shared iFolders</h3>
<p class="HEAD">An iFolder is a local directory that selectively shares and synchronizes files via a central server with a user-specified group of users. The iFolder files are accessible to all iFolder members and can be changed by those with the rights to do so. You can access your iFolders across multiple workstations and share them with others.</p>
<p class="HEAD">You work with iFolders directly in your file manager or in the iFolders browser that is part of the client. Within the iFolder, you can set up any subdirectory structure that suits your personal or corporate work habits. The subdirectory structure is constant across all member iFolders. When you share an iFolder, member users with the Write right can modify the directory structure, and those changes apply to all copies of the iFolder. Each user can specify a different location for the shared iFolder on his or her own computer.</p>
</div>

<div class="Head" title="iFolder Access Rights">
<a name="bq1r113"></a>

<h3 class="HEAD-TITLE"><br />iFolder Access Rights</h3>
<p class="HEAD">The iFolder client supports the owner and three levels of access for members of an iFolder: </p>
<ul class="LISTBULLET">
<li class="BULLETITEM"><p class="PARAWITHTITLE"><a name="bq8voz4"></a><em class="PARAWITHTITLE">Owner: </em>Only one user serves as the owner of an iFolder. This is typically the user who created the iFolder. The owner user can use the iFolder client to transfer ownership to another member of the iFolder. The iFolder administrator can transfer ownership to any user on the iFolder server, using administrator tools.</p>
<p class="BULLETITEM">The owner of an iFolder has the Full Control right. This user has read/write access to the iFolder, manages membership and access rights for member users, and can remove the Full Control right for any member. With an enterprise server, the disk space used by the owner's iFolders count against the owner's user disk quotas on the enterprise server. </p>
<p class="BULLETITEM">If an owner user is deleted as a user for the iFolder server, the iFolders owned by the user are orphaned. Orphaned iFolders are assigned temporarily to the iFolder administrator, who serves as a temporary custodial owner. Membership and synchronization continues while the iFolder administrator determines whether an orphaned iFolder should be deleted or assigned to a new owner.</p></li>

<li class="BULLETITEM"><p class="PARAWITHTITLE"><a name="bq8voz5"></a><em class="PARAWITHTITLE">Full Control: </em>A member of the shared iFolder, with the Full Control access right. This member has read/write access to the iFolder and manages membership and access rights for all users except the owner. </p></li>

<li class="BULLETITEM"><p class="PARAWITHTITLE"><a name="bq8voz6"></a><em class="PARAWITHTITLE">Read/Write: </em>A member of the shared iFolder, with the Read/Write access right to directories and files in the iFolder.</p></li>

<li class="BULLETITEM"><p class="PARAWITHTITLE"><a name="bq8voz7"></a><em class="PARAWITHTITLE">Read Only: </em>A member of the shared iFolder, with the Read Only access right to directories and files in the iFolder. This member can modify a file, but the local changes are not synchronized back to the server.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="HEAD">When used with an enterprise server account, the server hosts every iFolder created for that account. When you create an iFolder, the enterprise server makes it available to the specified list of users. You can have a only one account on any given enterprise server, but you can have multiple accounts.</p>
<p class="HEAD">Any iFolder account holder can own some iFolders and be a member of other iFolders. As an owner users, you always have the Full Control right. As a member user, your level of access in each shared iFolder can differ, depending on the access granted to you by any member with the Full Control right.</p>
</div>

<div class="Head" title="Account Setup for Enterprise Servers">
<a name="bq655zc"></a>

<h3 class="HEAD-TITLE"><br />Account Setup for Enterprise Servers</h3>
<p class="HEAD">The iFolder client allows you to set up multiple accounts, where a single account represents a given enterprise server. You specify the server address, username, and password to uniquely identify an account. On your computer, log in as the local user identity you plan to use to access an account and its iFolders, then set up the iFolder. Under your local login, you can set up multiple iFolder accounts, but each account must belong to a different iFolder enterprise server.  </p>
</div>

<div class="Head" title="Access Authentication">
<a name="bq5xp9r"></a>

<h3 class="HEAD-TITLE"><br />Access Authentication</h3>
<p class="HEAD">Whenever iFolder connects to an enterprise server to synchronize files, it connects with HTTP BASIC or HTTPS (SSL) connections to the server, and the server authenticates the user against its LDAP directory service. The administrator determines whether iFolder traffic uses HTTP  BASIC or HTTPS connections.</p>
</div>

<div class="Head" title="File Synchronization and Data Management">
<a name="bq1r118"></a>

<h3 class="HEAD-TITLE"><br />File Synchronization and Data Management</h3>
<p class="HEAD">When you set up an iFolder account, you can enable Remember Password so that iFolder can synchronize iFolder invitations and files in the background as you work. </p>
<p class="HEAD">You can configure the iFolder client to run automatically each time you log in to your computer's desktop environment. The session runs in the background as you work with files in your local iFolders, tracking and logging any changes you make. </p>
<p class="HEAD">You can synchronize the files at specified intervals or on demand.</p>
</div>

<div class="Head" title="Synchronization Log">
<a name="bq63xvh"></a>

<h3 class="HEAD-TITLE"><br />Synchronization Log</h3>
<p class="HEAD">The synchronization log displays a log of your iFolder background activity, such as uploading and downloading files for different iFolders. </p>
</div>
