<div class="Topic" title="Key Features of iFolder">

<h2 class="TOPIC-TITLE"><br />Key Features of iFolder</h2>
<p class="TOPIC">Before you begin to use iFolder, it is important to understand the following key features:</p>
<ul class="LISTBULLET">
<li class="BULLETITEM"><a href="bq1r110.html#bq1r111">The iFolder Client </a></li>

<li class="BULLETITEM"><a href="bq1r110.html#bq1r112">Shared iFolders</a></li>

<li class="BULLETITEM"><a href="bq1r110.html#bq1r113">iFolder Access Rights</a></li>

<li class="BULLETITEM"><a href="bq1r110.html#bq655zc">Account Setup for Enterprise Servers</a></li>

<li class="BULLETITEM"><a href="bq1r110.html#bq5xp9r">Access Authentication</a></li>

<li class="BULLETITEM"><a href="bq1r110.html#bq1r118">File Synchronization and Data Management</a></li>

<li class="BULLETITEM"><a href="bq1r110.html#bq63xvh">Sync Log</a></li>
</ul>
<div class="Head" title="The iFolder Client ">
<a name="bq1r111"></a>

<h3 class="HEAD-TITLE"><br />The iFolder Client </h3>
<p class="HEAD">The iFolder client integrates with your operating system to provide iFolder services in your native desktop environment. iFolder supports the following operating systems:</p>
<ul class="LISTBULLET">
<li class="BULLETITEM">Novell Linux Desktop 1.0</li>

<li class="BULLETITEM">Windows 2000/XP</li>

<li class="BULLETITEM">Macintosh OS X 10.3 or later</li>
</ul>
<p class="HEAD">An iFolder session begins when you log in to an iFolder services account and ends when you log out, or when you exit the iFolder client. Your iFolders synchronize files with other active iFolders only when your session is active and you are working online. You can access data in your local iFolders at any time, whether you are logged in to the account, or not.</p>
<p class="HEAD">The iFolder client allows users to manage their iFolders. For information, see <a href="myifolders.html#myifolders">Managing iFolders</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="Head" title="Shared iFolders">
<a name="bq1r112"></a>

<h3 class="HEAD-TITLE"><br />Shared iFolders</h3>
<p class="HEAD">An iFolder is a local directory that selectively shares and synchronizes files with a user-specified workgroup in a peer-to-peer sharing model. The iFolder files are accessible to all workgroup members and can be changed by those with the rights to do so. You can share iFolders across multiple workstations and with others.</p>
<p class="HEAD">You work with iFolders directly in your file manager. Within the iFolder, you can set up any subdirectory structure that suits your personal or corporate work habits. The subdirectory structure is constant across all member iFolders. Each workstation can specify a different parent directory for the shared iFolder.</p>
</div>

<div class="Head" title="iFolder Access Rights">
<a name="bq1r113"></a>

<h3 class="HEAD-TITLE"><br />iFolder Access Rights</h3>
<p class="HEAD">The iFolder client provides three levels of access for members of an iFolder: </p>
<ul class="LISTBULLET">
<li class="BULLETITEM"><p class="PARAWITHTITLE"><a name="bq8voz4"></a><em class="PARAWITHTITLE">Owner: </em>The owner of the primary shared iFolder, with ownership and the Full Control right. The iFolder owner has read/write access to the iFolder, manages membership and access rights for users, and can remove the Full Control right for any member. The owner's computer is the host for the iFolder workgroup and must be active and online to synchronize files with member iFolders. With an enterprise server, the disk space used by the owner's iFolders count against the owner's user disk quotas on the enterprise server.</p>
<p class="BULLETITEM">Only one user serves as the owner. This is typically the user who created the iFolder. The owner or an iFolder administrator can transfer ownership status from the owner to another user. The new can be a new or existing member of the iFolder.</p></li>

<li class="BULLETITEM"><p class="PARAWITHTITLE"><a name="bq8voz5"></a><em class="PARAWITHTITLE">Full Control: </em>A member of the shared iFolder, with the Full Control access right. The user with the Full Control right has read/write access to the iFolder and manages membership and access rights for all users except the owner. </p></li>

<li class="BULLETITEM"><p class="PARAWITHTITLE"><a name="bq8voz6"></a><em class="PARAWITHTITLE">Read/Write: </em>A member of the shared iFolder, with the Read/Write access right to directories and files in the iFolder.</p></li>

<li class="BULLETITEM"><p class="PARAWITHTITLE"><a name="bq8voz7"></a><em class="PARAWITHTITLE">Read Only: </em>A member of the shared iFolder, with the Read Only access right to directories and files in the iFolder. This member can copy an iFolder file to another location and modify it outside the iFolder.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="HEAD">When used with an enterprise server account, the server hosts every iFolder created for that account. Users create an iFolder and the enterprise server makes it available to the specified list of users. A user can have a separate account on each enterprise server.</p>
<p class="HEAD">Any given workstation can be both a host and a client in the workgroup model. You can host multiple iFolders on your workstation and be a member of iFolder workgroups hosted by others. Your level of membership in each shared iFolder can differ.</p>
</div>

<div class="Head" title="Account Setup for Enterprise Servers">
<a name="bq655zc"></a>

<h3 class="HEAD-TITLE"><br />Account Setup for Enterprise Servers</h3>
<p class="HEAD">The iFolder client allows you to set up multiple accounts across domains, where a domain is represented by a given enterprise server. You specify the server address, username, and password to uniquely identify an account. On your computer, you set up accounts while logged in as the local identity you plan to use to access that account and its iFolders. Under your local login, you can setup up multiple iFolder accounts, but each account must belong to a different iFolder enterprise server.  </p>
</div>

<div class="Head" title="Access Authentication">
<a name="bq5xp9r"></a>

<h3 class="HEAD-TITLE"><br />Access Authentication</h3>
<p class="HEAD">Whenever an iFolder connects to member iFolders in the workgroup to synchronize files, it verifies the target and destination servers to prevent spoofing.</p>
<p class="HEAD">Whenever iFolder connects to an enterprise server to synchronize files, it connects with basic HTML and SSL connections to the server, and the server authenticates the user against the domain's LDAP directory service. </p>
</div>

<div class="Head" title="File Synchronization and Data Management">
<a name="bq1r118"></a>

<h3 class="HEAD-TITLE"><br />File Synchronization and Data Management</h3>
<p class="HEAD">When you set up an iFolder account, you can enable Remember Password so that iFolder can synchronize iFolder invitations and files in the background as you work. The iFolder client runs automatically each time you log in to your computer's desktop environment. The session runs in the background as you work with files in your local iFolders, tracking and logging any changes you make. </p>
<p class="HEAD">With an enterprise server, you can synchronize the files at specified intervals or on demand.</p>
<p class="HEAD">With a workgroup, the iFolder client synchronizes files at specified intervals or on demand, but only if an iFolder's primary host is available at that time.</p>
</div>

<div class="Head" title="Sync Log">
<a name="bq63xvh"></a>

<h3 class="HEAD-TITLE"><br />Sync Log</h3>
<p class="HEAD">The log displays a log of your iFolder background activity. </p>
</div>
