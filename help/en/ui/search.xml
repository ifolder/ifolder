  <title>Benefits of iFolder</title>
  <url>../benefits.html</url>
  <content>Benefits of iFolder iFolder provides the following benefits: iFolder integrates with your native desktop environment, making it easy to create and manage multiple iFolders. iFolder is highly scalable and flexible, with no practical limit on the number of iFolders per user or on the number of members per iFolder. With encryption enabled, iFolder protects data as it travels across the wire and is stored on the iFolder server. With the enhanced Web Access console, you can access your files on the iFolder server from any workstation without the iFolder client, and use a Web browser to perform all the operations of iFolder client. You can easily and selectively share personal and business files. iFolder can migrate and upgrade your iFolder data to the latest version. iFolder supports LDAPGroups. You can share iFolders with LDAPGroups. Members of the LDAPGroup can create, own and share iFolders with other individual users or other LDAPGroups. You can control the access level of member users of the iFolders you own, or where you have the necessary rights to control the access rights of members. iFolder transparently updates your files to member iFolders on multiple workstations. When iFolder is running, it tracks and logs changes made while you work offline, and synchronizes those changes when you connect to the server. iFolder provides secure authentication of members who access an iFolder to synchronize its data. iFolders offers an alternative to exchanging files via e-mail, which avoids the file-size limits on e-mail attachments and reduces your e-mail storage requirements. </content>

  <title>iFolder Account</title>
  <url>../bawqmpe.html</url>
  <content>iFolder Account An iFolder account is created when an iFolder services administrator provisions you as an iFolder user for an iFolder server. The administrator provides you with a username and password. For an enterprise, this might be your username or e-mail address and the related password. You must configure at least one iFolder account before you can create iFolders. For more information, see . An iFolder session begins when you log in to an iFolder services account and ends when you log out, or when you exit the iFolder client. Your iFolders synchronize files with other active iFolders only when your session is active and you are working online. You can access data in your local iFolders at any time, whether you are logged in to the account, or not. For information, see . </content>

  <content>Cross-Platform Considerations The user interfaces for the Linux, Windows, and Macintosh versions of the iFolder client conform to interface conventions of their individual platforms. The way you perform common tasks is parallel in each platform, but you might observe slight differences in the buttons, the display area, function labels, the location of the desktop notification area, the start iFolder preference, and so on as you perform the tasks. Except where procedures differ explicitly, this guide provides instructions for only one of the three platforms. The following table lists some typical differences and similarities in the client interface: Task Linux Windows Macintosh iFolder menu Quit Exit Quit iFolder Preferences &gt; Accounts dialog Add button Add button Plus ( + ) button iFolder Preference Accounts dialog Remove button Remove button Minus ( - ) button Multiple locations Close button Actions are committed when you perform the action OK , Cancel , and Apply buttons Actions are committed only when you click Apply or OK OK and Cancel button Actions are committed when you perform the action iFolder Preferences dialog Add iFolder to the desktop’s Startup Programs Select (enable) Start iFolder when logging In to the desktop This feature is not available Configuring an iFolder Account Remember my password Remember password on this computer Remember Password Notification area Notification area Status and Notification area Notification area Right-click notification area Account Settings Accounts This feature is not available iFolders iFolder menu Properties Properties Get Info iFolder Wizards Forward button and Back button Next button and Back button No buttons to move front and back.

  <title>Key Features of iFolder</title>
  <url>../keyfeatures.html</url>
  <content>Key Features of iFolder Before you begin to use iFolder, it is important to understand the following key features: iFolder Sharing Typically, when you work in multiple locations or in collaboration with others, you must conscientiously manage file versions. With iFolder, the most recent version of your files can follow you to any computer where you have installed the iFolder client and created an iFolder for them. iFolder also allows you to share multiple iFolders and their separate content with other authorized users or LDAPGroups. For more information on shared iFolder, see . The iFolder client supports sharing by synchronizing files across multiple computers through a central server. It allows you to do the following: Share files across computers Share files with others Own multiple iFolders Participate in multiple iFolders that other users share with you Participate as the owner or a member of iFolders in multiple accounts You work with iFolders directly in your file manager or in the iFolder browser that is part of the client. Within the iFolder, you can set up any subdirectory structure that suits your personal or corporate work habits. The subdirectory structure is constant across all member iFolders. Shared iFolders An iFolder is a local directory that selectively shares and synchronizes files via a central server with user-specified users. The iFolder files are accessible to all iFolder members and can be changed by those with the rights to do so. You can access your iFolders across multiple workstations and share them with both individual users and LDAPGroups. You decide who participates in each iFolder and the level of access for each member. Similarly, you can participate in shared iFolders that are owned by others in your collaboration environment. When you share an iFolder, member users with the Write permission can modify the directory structure, and those changes apply to all copies of the iFolder. Each user can locate the shared iFolder anywhere on his or her own computer if it satisfies the requirements in . iFolder Access Rights The iFolder client supports the owner and three levels of access for members of an iFolder: Members of an LDAPGroup inherit the access rights set for that group. Owner: Only one user serves as the owner of an iFolder. This is typically the user who creates the iFolder. The owner user can use the iFolder client to transfer ownership to another member of the iFolder. The owner of an iFolder has the Full Control right. This user has Read/Write access to the iFolder, manages membership and access rights for member users, and can remove the Full Control right for any member. If an LDAPGroup owns an iFolders, all the member users of that group are given the full control right. Full Control: A member of the shared iFolder, with the Full Control access right. This member has Read/Write access to the iFolder and manages membership and access rights for all users except the owner. Read/Write: A member of the shared iFolder, with the Read/Write access right to the directories and files in the iFolder. This member can modify a file, but the local changes are synchronized to other members’ copies of the iFolder. Read Only: A member of the shared iFolder, with the Read Only access right to directories and files in the iFolder. This member can modify a file, but the local changes are not synchronized to other members’ copies of the iFolder. Any iFolder user or LDAPGroup can own some iFolders and be a member of other iFolders. As an owner user, you always have the Full Control right. As a member user, your level of access in each shared iFolder can differ, depending on the access granted to you by any member with the Full Control right. File Synchronization When you are connected to the server, iFolder can synchronize iFolder membership and files in the background as you work. When you set up an iFolder account, you can enable Remember My Password so that iFolder can remember the password on that machine, and next time when you launch iFolder, it is automatically connects to the server and synchronize the data without prompting for the password. You can configure the iFolder client to run automatically each time you log in to your computer’s desktop environment. The session runs in the background as you work with files in your local iFolders, tracking and logging any changes you make. You can synchronize the files manually or at specified intervals. iFolder also has delta synchronization capabilities. When you make any changes to an iFolder file, only the deltas or changes are synchronized to the server. In other words, delta synchronization only retrieves updates since the last synchronization between the iFolder client and the server. This increases the efficiency, because it reduces the synchronization time. Migration Novell iFolder provides a simple, hassle-free user interface for client-side migration from iFolder2.x to iFolder 3.6 and later. The Migration Wizard provided in the iFolder client helps you migrate the existing iFolder 2. x data to iFolder 3.6 and later quickly and easily. For more information, see . Encryption iFolder provides higher security for your confidential iFolder files, to protect them from intentional or unintentional access by unauthorized people. In the past, data security was not ensured on the server side, so the data was accessible to the administrator or to anyone who gained unauthorized access to the server. In addition, when you access iFolder files via an ISP provider, there is a chance that an unauthorized individual can inadvertently stumble across your confidential files. Now, you can encrypt and save your files on the server, and retrieve them through a passphrase known only to you. If you forget your passphrase, the Recovery agent you have selected during the creation of the encrypted iFolder helps you recover your data. Encrypted iFolders cannot be shared. For more information on encryption, see . Upgrade Novell iFolder provides a simple upgrade from iFolder 3. x to the iFolder client for Novell iFolder 3.6 and above versions. For more information, see . Merge With Merge, you can consolidate the iFolder data and minimize the data transfer between the iFolder client and the server. Merge also allows you to move an existing folder to a different location on the client machine. For more information, see . Default iFolder iFolder allows you to set up a default iFolder when you configure a new account. Whenever you configure a new iFolder account, iFolder automatically checks for the presence of the default iFolder. If you have not created a default iFolder, iFolder prompts you to create one. If it already exists, the iFolder client prompts you to download. You are also allowed to ignore both these options. For more information, see in the . Enhanced Web Access iFolder provides an enhanced Web interface that allows you to access your iFolder files on remote servers. With the Web Access console, you can use a Web browser to access your files on the iFolder server from any workstation without the iFolder client. The Web Access interface enables you to perform all the operations of the iFolder client. When compared to the previous iFolder versions, iFolder 3.6 and later versions lets you create, browse, share, upload and delete iFolders via the enhanced Web access console. Mobile users can also make use of this facility through the Web. Synchronization Log The synchronization log displays a log of your iFolder background activity, such as uploading and downloading files for different iFolders, policy violations, excluded files, and non-synchronized files. </content>

  <title>Starting the iFolder Client</title>
  <url>../startclient.html</url>
  <content>Starting the iFolder Client When iFolder is running, the iFolder Services icon appears in the notification area of the taskbar. iFolder is integrated in the desktop environment. The iFolder emblem (a green “i”) appears on iFolders when they are viewed in a file manager, on the desktop, or in the iFolder browser. The encrypted iFolder is indicated by the emblem (locked folder). The notification area of the taskbar must be enabled in order for the iFolder Services icon to be displayed when iFolder is running. You can work locally with files in your local iFolders at any time. Whenever the iFolder client is running, it logs the changes you make to local iFolder data as you work. If you make changes to local iFolder data when iFolder is not running, iFolder identifies and logs the differences the next time you start iFolder. When iFolder is not running, iFolders appear in the file manager or on the desktop. You can access files in your local copy of an iFolder, but you cannot manage iFolders. In addition, you must log in to an account to create an iFolder or synchronize its files. During account creation, user login happens through SSL. When you are prompted to accept the server certificate, you must validate the certificate and accept it for a successful connection. For information about stopping the iFolder client, see .

  <title>Configuring an iFolder Account</title>
  <url>../accounts.html</url>
  <content>Configuring an iFolder Account Use the iFolder Account Creation Wizard to add and configure a new account. You must configure at least one iFolder account before you can create iFolders or share iFolders on your system. You can connect to the iFolder server with only one account at any given time. However, to connect to more than one iFolder servers, you can configure multiple accounts. You can log in separately to each account and be logged in concurrently to multiple accounts. Multiple users with different local login identities will have iFolders on the same computer. The first time you start iFolder under your current local login identity, iFolder prompts you to set up an iFolder account. iFolder 3.7 and later versions introduce a new feature, auto-account creation, which helps the iFolder administrator to create and configure an account for you. If your iFolder administrator has enabled auto-account creation, you don’t need to configure an account for yourself. When you start an iFolder for the first time, you are prompted to enter your password. Enter your password and complete configuring the account. To configure a new account: Access the iFolder Account Creation Wizard , using one of the following methods: The first time you start iFolder under your current local login identity, iFolder prompts you to set up an iFolder account. Click Forward to go directly to the iFolder Account Creation Wizard . Right-click the iFolder Services icon in the notification area, select Accounts to open the iFolder Preferences dialog box to the Accounts tab, then click Add to open the iFolder Account Creation Wizard . Follow the on-screen instructions to specify the following values: Parameter Description Server Address The DNS name or IP address of the iFolder enterprise server where you have an account. Get this information from your iFolder administrator. For example: svr21.example.com or 192.168.1.1 The server name is always displayed along with it’s IP address in the iFolder user interface. For example: iFolder - 192.168.1.1 You cannot use an iFolder 3.7 or later client to connect to an iFolder 3.2 server. Set this as my default server If you have multiple servers connected to your account, select the Set this as my default server check box to set the selected server from the drop-down list of servers as the default Server when you create or upload an ifolder. User Name Specify your user identity for this account. Your iFolder administrator decides whether the format you should use must be your network user ID (LDAP common name) or your e-mail address. For example, if your name is John Smith with a user ID of jsmith and an e-mail address of john.smith@example.com , your administrator configures a setting for the server that determines which of the two formats to accept in the Username field for authentication purposes. Password Specify the password for your username. Authentication happens through Secure channel (SSL). You are prompted to validate and accept the server certificate. Remember Password Select the Remember Password on this computer check box to log in automatically to this iFolder account whenever you log in to your computer. If your network password changes, automatic authentication fails gracefully the next time iFolder attempts to log in to the iFolder account. iFolder prompts you to log in with your new password and allows you to specify and save the new password. Verify the information entered by you. To make any changes, click the Back button and revisit the previous pages. Click Connect to proceed and validate your connection with the server. If you are prompted to Accept the certificate of this server , click Details to review the certificate information, then click OK to accept it. During the account creation, login happens through SSL. When you are prompted to accept the server certificate, you must validate the certificate and accept it for a successful connection. If the administrator has enabled the encryption policy , iFolder prompts you to enter your passphrase. Enter your passphrase in the Passphrase field. Re-enter the passphrase in Retype the passphrase field. Select Remember the Passphrase check box to automatically access the encrypted iFolder data during the current session. If you select this option, iFolder can remember your passphrase during the next login process. This passphrase exchange is done automatically. Select the desired Recovery agent from the list and click OK . Specify the location where you want to create the default iFolder. By default, the default iFolder is stored at &lt;users home directory&gt;/ifolder/server_name/user_name . Select the type of the Default iFolder that you want to create. If you choose Encryption , you will be prompted to provide the passphrase. You can share only the regular iFolders. Encrypted iFolders cannot be shared. If your iFolder administrator has not enabled encryption for your current account, you can create only regular iFolders, and if encryption is enabled, the Regular option is selected by default. Select Secure Sync to enable secure synchronization of files in the iFolder you are creating. You can enable secure channel for both regular and encrypted iFolders. With this option selected, iFolder allows you to use a secure channel to synchronize between iFolder on the server and on the local machine. If you remove the default iFolder on the server, the next time you configure the account from any thick client, iFolder prompts you to create a default iFolder again. However, if you remove the default iFolder from the local machine, the next time you configure the account, iFolder prompts you to download the default iFolder. If you have already set up a default iFolder, you can download it to your local machine. Download the default iFolder and click Next to proceed. If a folder with the same name as the default ifolder already exists on your system, you are prompted to either merge the two folders or download the default ifolder to a different location. Click OK to merge the two folders or click Cancel to download the default iFolder to a different location Click Finish to close the iFolder Account Creation Wizard. iFolder synchronizes the user list for the specified account and identifies iFolders that are available for download. This initial download can take a few seconds to a few minutes, depending on the size of the user list for the account. Verify that the account you set up appears in the list of accounts. Right-click the iFolder Services icon in the notification area, then select Preferences from the menu to open the iFolder Preferences dialog box to the Accounts tab. When you are connected to the iFolder server, the Online check box is selected. Close the iFolder Preferences dialog box. Set up iFolders for the account using either of these methods: Right-click the iFolder Services icon in the notification area, then select iFolders to open the iFolder browser. Continue with . If iFolders for this account are available for download from the server, they are listed on the iFolder window under iFolders on &lt; iFolder_server_name &gt;. The download icon indicates that the iFolder is available for download. Continue with . </content>

  <title>Configuring Local Firewall Settings for iFolder Traffic</title>
  <url>../firewall.html</url>
  <content>Configuring Local Firewall Settings for iFolder Traffic If you use a local firewall, you must set your firewall to allow iFolder to choose a local dynamic port or configure a local static port for the iFolder client to communicate locally (the same computer) with Mono® XSP Server. iFolder uses Mono XSP Web services to communicate via HTTP with the Novell iFolder enterprise servers where you have iFolder accounts. The iFolder administrator configures iFolder services that determine whether communications use HTTP in your environment. Your firewall does not block traffic between Mono XSP and the Novell iFolder enterprise server because Mono XSP uses the standard HTTP ports for traffic. However, if you block the traffic between the client and Mono XSP, the client cannot communicate with the server. You cannot log in to your iFolder account and synchronize iFolder data. Initially, the iFolder configuration does not specify a particular port to use for client-to-Mono XSP communications. When iFolder first runs, it opens an available local port to listen for requests from Mono XSP and to send data to the server via Mono XSP. It writes the port number to a configuration file and uses this port thereafter unless the port is not available whenever iFolder starts. If the port is in use by another application, iFolder selects a different available port, reconfigures the port in the configuration file, and uses the new port thereafter. For example, if iFolder is down and another application takes the port, iFolder must select and configure a different port to use when you restart iFolder. Using a Local Dynamic Port If you use a local firewall on your computer, the firewall should detect the local traffic between the iFolder and Mono XSP server whenever iFolder contacts the server to synchronize its list of users and iFolder data. Select Allow to permit the iFolder traffic for this session. If you allow the traffic permanently, your firewall should not remind you again, and you can avoid receiving the pop-up alerts whenever iFolder starts. If you block the iFolder-to-Mono XSP traffic, your firewall prevents you from connecting with the iFolder server and you cannot synchronize your files. iFolder does not detect that traffic is blocked by the firewall; it reports only that it cannot connect to your account on the iFolder server. Using a Local Static Port You can optionally add the Web Service Port Range parameter in the Service Manager section of the Simias.config file to allow Mono XSP Server to use a static port or a range of ports for this local traffic. This port or range of ports can then be opened in the firewall to allow communications for Mono XSP. You can find Simias.config in the following locations: Operating System Location of the Simias.config File Linux /home/ username /.local/share/simias/Simias.config Windows C:\Documents and Settings\ username \Local Settings\Application Data\simias\Simias.config To configure your system to use a specific port or range of ports: Configure your firewall to allow traffic for the port or range of ports you want to use for iFolder traffic. See your firewall’s documentation for information on how to open a port in the firewall. Stop the iFolder client by right-clicking the iFolder icon, then selecting Exit . Modify the Simias.config file by adding the Web Service Port Range parameter to the Service Manager section. &lt;configuration&gt; &lt;section name="ServiceManager"&gt; &lt;setting name="WebServicePortRange" value=" monoxsp_port " /&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/configuration&gt; Replace monoxsp_port with a port number or range of port numbers: Specify a value of a single four-digit port number (such as 1234) to use a single static port. For example: &lt;setting name="WebServicePortRange" value=" 1234 " /&gt; Specify a range of ports (such as “1234-1236”) to use any available port in the specified range of ports. For example: &lt;setting name="WebServicePortRange" value=" 1234-1236 " /&gt; Start the iFolder client. For more information, see . </content>

  <title>Configuring Local Virus Scanner Settings for iFolder Traffic</title>
  <url>../virusscan.html</url>
  <content>Configuring Local Virus Scanner Settings for iFolder Traffic If you use virus scanning software on your computer, exclude the ..\simias\WorkArea\ directory from the virus scan. For example, the location of the ..\simias\WorkArea\ directory on Windows is c:\documents and settings\ username \local settings\application data\simias\WorkArea\.simias.wf. guid . The ..\simias\WorkArea\ directory is where iFolder stages files for download from the server. If an iFolder file has a virus attached and your virus scanning software scans that virus while the file is in the ..\simias\WorkArea directory, the virus scanner pops up with a message indicating that a virus has been found, moves the file to quarantine, then iFolder again tries to synchronize the file. Not scanning the WorkArea allows the synchronization to finish. The infected file is successfully downloaded and moved to the local iFolder. The virus scanner then detects the infected file in the iFolder and moves it from that folder to quarantine, protecting the computer from infection. iFolder detects the deletion of the file and when the next synchronization begins, iFolder removes the file from the server and member computers. However, if the iFolder where the file is downloaded is Read-Only, the local deletion is not enforced to the server and other member computers. The virus must be detected elsewhere where permissions allow changes to be synchronized. The user’s virus scanner probably alerts the user of the virus, so the user should alert other iFolder members about the virus. </content>

  <content>Deleting an iFolder Account You can specify whether to remove an account only from the current computer, or whether to also remove the iFolders you own from the server. If you remove an iFolder account only from your computer: The local iFolders for this account are reverted to normal folders. Use a file manager to locate and delete the local copy of the data if it is not needed. You can continue to access the iFolders from other computers with the iFolder client. When the iFolder client is used with a Novell iFolder 3.7 or later enterprise server, you can also access files from anywhere with Novell iFolder 3.7 or later Web Access. If you remove your iFolder account from the server: All of the iFolders you own are unshared. The local copies of iFolders on member computers are reverted to normal folders. Use a file manager to locate and delete the local copy of the data if it is not needed. The iFolder and its contents are removed from the server. You are removed as a member of iFolders that others shared with you. The account is removed from the local computer.

  <title>Guidelines for the Location and Use of iFolders</title>
  <url>../locguide.html</url>
  <content>Guidelines for the Location and Use of iFolders Generally, you can put iFolders anywhere on your local hard drive when you create an iFolder or set up an iFolder that is shared with you. However, there are some practical and specific limitations. Consider the following guidelines for placing and using iFolders on your computer: An iFolder’s name must be a unique folder name in the directory where you put the iFolder. An iFolder’s name cannot contain the following invalid characters: \/:*?"&lt;&gt;|; For other naming conventions, see . The iFolder must reside on a local hard drive; the location cannot be on a network drive or non-physical drive. An iFolder cannot exist at the root of the hard drive. An iFolder can be created only from a folder where you have the file system access rights to read and write files. When you set up a shared iFolder on a computer, you must have file system access rights to the folder where you are placing the iFolder. An iFolder cannot contain or reside in an applications folder such as the Program Files folder. The iFolder cannot contain or reside in the iFolder metadata folder. The default location of the metadata folder is as follows: Linux: In your home folder in the &lt;Home Directory&gt;\.local\share \ simias subdirectory Windows: In the C:\Documents and Settings\ WindowsLogonUsername \Local Settings\Application Data\simias directory Macintosh: In the $HOME/.local/share/simias An iFolder cannot contain or reside in other iFolders, including your Novell iFolder 2. x iFolder. iFolder does not support network folders as iFolders. For example, iFolders cannot be the users’ network-based /home directories that are mapped to the users’ workstations. iFolder also does not support WebDAV access for users from their desktop to their iFolder collection on the iFolder server’s user-data volume. Although you can log in to more than one iFolder account at a time, an iFolder can be associated with only one iFolder account. You cannot synchronize one iFolder against multiple accounts. When you create an iFolder, the iFolder can be shared only with other users and LDAPGroups that are provisioned in the same iFolder server or domain. An iFolder is available to all the members of an LDAPGroup when it is shared with that LDAPGroup. When multiple users share a computer, the local copies of your iFolders are private to your storage space on the disk if the file system supports privacy features, and if you configure your system to use them. On Windows, NTFS includes built-in security features such as file and folder permissions and the Encrypting File System (EFS), which is the technology used to store encrypted files on NTFS volumes. These security features are not supported on FAT32 file systems. Make sure the local login identities for users (other than the Administrator identity, of course) do not have the Administrator rights or equivalent. The Administrator user has access to all files and directories on the computer. For shared computers where privacy and security are essential for each user, the users can encrypt their local copy of iFolder data with EFS or a third-party file system encryption. Linux and Macintosh file systems are designed for multi-user environments. File permissions allow you to control access for the user, groups, and others. A user’s personal files are typically set with full permissions for the user and no access for the groups and others settings. If you store iFolders locally on a FAT32 volume on Linux, it requires special handling because FAT32 file systems are not POSIX* compliant. For information, see . If users of the same computer share iFolders, multiple copies of the iFolder can exist on the device, with a copy for each user who downloads it from the server. Different local login identities cannot share a single location for the shared iFolders. </content>

  <title>Guidelines for File Types and Sizes to Not Synchronize</title>
  <url>../typeguide.html</url>
  <content>Guidelines for File Types and Sizes to Not Synchronize When the iFolder client is used, your iFolder administrator might specify file type restrictions and maximum file size restrictions at the system, user, LDAPGroup or iFolder level. Your account might also be restricted in the amount of space you can use for the data in the iFolders you own. When you participate in other iFolders, the space consumed on the server is counted against the owner of that iFolder. Some file types are not good candidates for synchronization, such as operating system files, hidden files created by a file manager, or databases that are implemented as a collection of linked files. You might include only key file types used for your business, or exclude files that are likely unrelated to business, such as .mp3 files. Operating System Files You should not convert system directories to iFolders. Most system files change infrequently and it is better to keep an image file of your basic system and key software than to attempt to synchronize those files to the server. Hidden Files If your file system uses hidden files to track display preferences, your administrator might restrict those file types to exclude them from being synchronized on your system. Usually, hidden files are relevant only to the particular computer where they were created, and they change every time the file or directory is accessed. You do not need to keep these files, and synchronizing them results in repeated file conflict errors. For example, iFolder automatically excludes two hidden file manager files called thumbs.db and .DS_Store . Database Files iFolder synchronizes individual files or the changed portions of individual files; it does not synchronize files as a set. If you have a database file that is implemented as a collection of linked files, do not try to synchronize them in an iFolder. Do not try to synchronize your GroupWise® data by making the GroupWise archive, cache, or remote directories into iFolders. If you do this, the GroupWise data files become corrupted after synchronizing the file a few times. GroupWise needs the files in the archive to be maintained as a set of files. </content>

  <title>Naming Conventions for an iFolder and Its Folders and Files</title>
  <url>../nameconv.html</url>
  <content>Naming Conventions for an iFolder and Its Folders and Files The iFolder client imposes naming conventions that consider the collective restrictions of the Linux, and Windows file systems. An iFolder, folder, or file must have a valid name that complies with the naming conventions before it can be synchronized. Use the following naming conventions for your iFolders and the folders and files in them: iFolder supports the Unicode * character set with UTF-8 encoding. Do not use the following invalid characters in the names of iFolders or in the names of folders and files in them: \/:*?"&lt;&gt;|; iFolder creates a name conflict if you use the invalid characters in a file or folder name. The conflict must be resolved before the file or folder can be synchronized. The maximum name length for single path component depends upon the client file system. For filenames, the maximum length includes the dot (.) and file extension. When you attempt to download or synchronize an iFolder whose name length exceeds the maximum limit supported by the file system, iFolder displays an error message. Names of iFolders, folders, and files are case insensitive; however, case is preserved. If filenames differ only by case, iFolder creates a name conflict. The conflict must be resolved before the file or folder can be synchronized. If you create iFolders on a FAT32 file system on Linux, avoid naming files in all uppercase characters. The VFAT or FAT32 file handling on Linux automatically changes the filenames that are all uppercase characters and meet the MS-DOS 8.3 file format from all uppercase characters to all lowercase characters. This creates synchronization problems for those files if the iFolder is set with the Read Only access right. </content>

  <content>Understanding iFolder Icons The following table describes iFolder icons and related tasks. iFolder Icon Description The iFolder Services icon is displayed for the iFolder 3 Client in the desktop Applications menu. When iFolder is running, the iFolder Services icon also appears in the Notification area of the desktop taskbar. Right-click it for a menu of possible tasks, including iFolder browser, Account Settings, Synchronization Log, Preferences, and Help. The Create iFolder icon is displayed in the iFolder browser. You can create a new iFolder or convert an existing folder to an iFolder. If you have multiple accounts, you must specify which account to use; an iFolder can belong to only one account. For information, see . The iFolder Download icon is displayed when an iFolder is available to you on the specified server, but you have not downloaded it to your local machine. You can download any combination of iFolders from different accounts to the local computer. For information, see . The encrypted iFolder icon (locked iFolder) indicates that the iFolder is encrypted and is displayed in the iFolder browser. The passphrase provided at the time of login enables you to retrieve the files in the encrypted iFolder. For more information on Encryption, see . The iFolder emblem (green “i”) appears on iFolders whenever the iFolder Services application is running for iFolders viewed in a file manager, on the desktop, or in the iFolder browser. When iFolder is not running, iFolders appear as normal folders when viewed in the file manager or on the desktop. The iFolder browser is not available when iFolder is not running. It is a good practice to organize your local collection of iFolders in a separate directory that contains only iFolders. This makes it easy to remember which folders are iFolders even when iFolder is not running and providing icons to mark them as iFolders. The iFolder Warning icon indicates that the server is unavailable. iFolder is running but you are not connected to the iFolder server. Possible causes are: You are not logged in to the iFolder account. For information, see . The account is disabled on the client side; that is, the Automatically connect parameter is disabled. For information, see Automatically connect in . The server is down or your account is disabled on the server side. Contact your iFolder administrator for assistance. Your firewall is blocking iFolder traffic. For information to resolve this problem, see . Your network connection is down. Check your local network settings. The iFolder Conflict icon indicates that there is a file conflict between the local copy and the server copy. Resolve the conflict by indicating which version of the file to keep. For more information on file conflict, see . The iFolder Waiting to Synchronize icon indicates that the iFolder contains files to be synchronized with the server, and the synchronization process has not yet begun. iFolder synchronizes one iFolder at a time, and queues the synchronization tasks. To make sure that files in this local iFolder are synchronized with the files on the server, wait to shut down iFolder until the synchronization begins and completes successfully, as indicated by the changes in the icon. The iFolder Synchronizing icon indicates that files in the iFolder are currently being synchronized with the server. The iFolder Error icon indicates that one or more files in the iFolder have not been synchronized because there is a policy conflict due to file size limit or limit on number of iFolders. In the Sharing dialog box, the iFolder Owner User icon indicates that the user owns the shared iFolder. In the Sharing dialog box, the iFolder Current User icon indicates that the user is currently managing the iFolder. If the current user is the owner, the Owner User icon is displayed instead. </content>

  <title>Creating and Uploading an iFolder</title>
  <url>../createifolder.html</url>
  <content>Creating and Uploading an iFolder You can create an iFolder by converting an existing folder that satisfies the following guidelines: If the folder does not exist, you can browse to a location and create the new folder as part of the process. You can share only the regular iFolders. Encrypted iFolders cannot be shared. Within the iFolder, you can set up any subdirectory structure that suits your personal or corporate work habits. The subdirectory structure is constant across all member iFolders. Each workstation can specify a different parent directory for the shared iFolder. When you exceed the limit for number of iFolders an individual user can create, iFolder displays an error message. For example, if your administrator has set the policy for Number of iFolder per user to 10 and you attempt to create the eleventh iFolder, you will receive a notification about the policy violation. Linux You can create iFolders with a file manager or with the iFolder browser, which is available in the client application. Use the following methods to create an iFolder: Creating iFolders in the iFolders Browser In the notification area, use one of the following methods to open the iFolder browser: Click the iFolder Services icon . Right-click the iFolder Services icon , then click iFolders . Click Create iFolder . Under More Options , specify the iFolder Account you want to use for this iFolder.

With this option selected, iFolder allows you use a secure channel to synchronize between iFolder on the server and on the local machine. Click OK . The iFolder appears in the iFolder browser window. Creating iFolders on a FAT32 Mount Point (Linux) On Linux, iFolder supports creating and using iFolders on a mount point for a FAT32 file system. Before you can create new iFolders or set up shared iFolders on a FAT32 volume on your Linux computer, the iFolder user must own the FAT32 mount point where you want to store the iFolders, and the /etc/fstab file must explicitly identify the iFolder user’s local user ID for the mount point. This is required because FAT32 does not support file permissions. Any other file system that does not support permissions has the same issue. For dual boot systems, you can access the data in iFolders as normal folders from the system where the folder is not set up as an iFolder. If you set up the folder as an iFolder on both platforms, the data set is stored in two different iFolders on the server, which consumes double your allocated server disk resources. Because the FAT32 file system does not support POSIX file system permissions, make sure the iFolder user is the local owner of the mount point. Modify the /etc/fstab file to set the user ID (UID) parameter of the user’s local login identity to the iFolder user who creates iFolders on that mount point. Log in to your computer as the root user. Create the directory where you want to mount the FAT32 file system. At a command prompt, enter mkdir /home/ username / fsmount Replace username with the username of the user who plans to use the FAT32 drive for iFolders. Replace fsmount with the directory name you want to use as the mount point. For example, if the username is jsmith and the directory name is fat32mntpt for a FAT32 drive or partition, enter mkdir /home/jsmith/fat32mntpt Mount the FAT32 drive at the desired mount point. At a command prompt, enter mount -t vfat /dev/ hda1 /home/ username / fsmount Replace /dev/ hda1 with the device or partition name of the non-Linux device. Replace username with the username of the iFolder user. Replace fsmount with the directory name you want to use as the mount point. Continuing the example, where the FAT32 file system ( vfat ) is on the hda4 device ( /dev/hda4 ), the username is jsmith , and the mount point directory is /home/ jsmith / fat32mntpt , enter mount -t vfat /dev/hda4 /home/jsmith/fat32mntpt Edit the /etc/fstab file by adding the uid=username parameter of the iFolder user on the line that defines the FAT32 mount point. /dev/ hda1 /home/ username / fsmount vfat uid= username Continuing the example, modify /etc/fstab file by adding uid=jsmith to the mount point: /dev/hda4 /home/jsmith/fat32mntpt vfat uid=jsmith </content>

  <title>Sharing an iFolder</title>
  <url>../sharewith.html</url>
  <content>Sharing an iFolder You can share an iFolder with multiple users. This section discusses the following tasks: Understanding User Access Rights The following table describes the capabilities associated with each level of access for users or LDAPGroup. All the members of an LDAPGroup inherit the access rights set for that LDAPGroup. Capability Owner Member with Full Control Member with Read/Write Member with Read Only With an enterprise server, the space consumed by the iFolder on the server is charged against the user’s quota Yes No No No Transfer ownership to another member whose state is iFolder User Yes No No No Set a quota for the iFolder No No No No Make the iFolder available to other users (sharing) Yes Yes No No Make the iFolder unavailable to other users (stop sharing) Yes Yes, except the owner No No Assign iFolder access rights for other users Yes Yes, except the owner No No Read directories and files in the iFolder Yes Yes Yes Yes Add, modify, or delete directories and files in the iFolder Yes Yes Yes No Rename directories and files in an iFolder Yes Yes Yes No Rename the iFolder No No No No Set up an iFolder on multiple computers Yes Yes Yes Yes Revert an iFolder (do not participate on a local computer) Yes Yes Yes Yes Delete an available iFolder to decline participating Yes Yes Yes Yes Delete the iFolder and delete the iFolder and its files from the server (make it a normal folder again and no longer share it with others) Yes No No No Accessing the Sharing Tab You can manage membership for the iFolder from the Sharing tab in the iFolder Properties dialog box. You can share iFolders only if the iFolder administrator has enabled the sharing policy for your account. If iFolder is not running, start iFolder. Do one of the following to open the iFolder Properties dialog box to the Sharing tab. In a file manager, right-click the iFolder you want to share, then select Share with . In the iFolder browser, select the iFolder, then select Share with . Adding a User to an iFolder On the Sharing tab, click Add to open the Select User dialog box. From the list of users, select one or more users or LDAPGroups by adding them to the Users to add list, then click OK . It can take several seconds for the users to synchronize up to the server. Soon after the sync, a notification appears at the bottom right of the page. On the Sharing tab, select one or more users who you want to assign the same access right. Click Rights , select the Full Control , Read/Write , or Read Only access right, then click OK . Repeat the previous steps until you have invited all the desired users or LDAPGroups to share the iFolder and have set their access rights. Click Close to close the iFolder Properties window. Modifying User Access Rights As the working relationships and status of members of an iFolder change, you might need to change a user’s access right for the iFolder. For example, you might want to give a trusted user the Full Control right for the iFolder. On the Sharing tab, select one or more users who you want to have the same access right. Select Rights , then specify the Full Control , Read/Write , or Read Only right. When you first invite a user or LDAPGroup to participate, the Make this user the owner of the iFolder option is disabled (dimmed) in the Access dialog box. If you intend to make the new user the owner, you must wait until the user’s state changes from Invited User to iFolder User , then you can transfer ownership. When you transfer the ownership to an LDAPGroup, all the members of that LDAPGroup get the ownership rights. Click OK , then click OK to close the iFolder Properties window. Removing a User from an iFolder To unshare an iFolder, you must remove a user or an LDAPGroup as a member of an iFolder. The iFolder on the user’s or LDAPGroup member’s workstation becomes a normal folder. A copy of the data remains on the former member’s workstation, but the files are no longer synchronized with the shared iFolder. On the Sharing tab, select one or more users from the list. Click Remove , and then click Yes . Transferring Ownership to an iFolder User The owner of an iFolder can transfer ownership of the iFolder to another individual member or LDAPGroup whose state is iFolder User. After the transfer, the original owner becomes a member with the Read/Write right, and the space consumed by the iFolder is charged against the new owner. When an LDAPGroup becomes the owner of an iFolder, all the members of the group get the ownership rights. In a file manager or the iFolder browser, right-click the iFolder you want to transfer, then select Share With to open the iFolder’s Properties dialog box to the Sharing tab. From the list of users, select the iFolder User who is to be the new owner, then click Rights . Select Make this user the owner of the iFolder . The Make this user the owner of the iFolder option is disabled (dimmed) in the Access dialog box if the user’s state is Invited User . In this case, exit the dialog box, wait until the user’s state changes from Invited User to iFolder User , then repeat the preceding steps to transfer ownership. Click OK , then click OK to close the iFolder Properties window. </content>

  <title>Merging iFolders</title>
  <url>../merge.html</url>
  <content>Merging iFolders Merge helps you consolidate the iFolder data and minimize the data transfer between iFolder server and client. You can merge the content in an iFolder on the server with the content on an existing local machine folder content. iFolder-to-Folder Merge You can merge an iFolder and a normal folder with the same name. For example, you can merge the content of an iFolder named corporate with that of a normal folder named corporate . Assume that the corporate iFolder has three sub folders: hr , finance, and marketing . You want to download the content of corporate iFolder to the folder named corporate, which contains only the hr and finance folders. In this case, you don’t need to download all the three folders to the corporate folder and increase the transfer rate. Instead, you can merge the corporate iFolder to the corporate folder so that the Merge to folder feature intelligently avoids downloading the sub folders hr and finance , and downloads only marketing sub folder. If the data in the corporate iFolder and corporate folder is different, a version conflict is displayed. You can resolve the conflicts manually. Similarly, if filename conflict is displayed, you can resolve it manually. To merge an iFolder on the server to an existing local machine folder content: In the iFolder browser, right-click the desired iFolder from the list of iFolders on the selected server, then select Merge to folder . Browse and select the folder and click OK . Now, the contents of these two folders are compared and the files that are not present in the folder is downloaded from the iFolder. The files that are not present in the iFolder, but available in the folder are uploaded. Moving Existing iFolders to Different Locations To move an existing iFolder named corporate to a different location on the client machine: Convert the corporate iFolder into a normal folder. You must not delete the iFolder on the server. For more information, see . Move the corporate folder to a different location. You must not change the folder name while it is being moved. In the iFolder browser window, select the corporate iFolder on the server, then click Merge to folder . Select the corporate folder on the local machine, then click OK to merge the content. If you use Sychronize Now (instead of Merge to folder ), as described in , it checks for all the data in the iFolder on the server, and synchronizes all the data.Thus it increases data transferring time. In other hand, Merge to folder minimize the data transfer as it only merges the contents of the iFolder and the normal folder. For more information on merging, see . Merging Migrated 2. x iFolders with 3.7 or later iFolders You can merge a migrated 2.x iFolder with an iFolder created in iFolder 3.7 or later server. For more information on migration, see . After migration, the 2. x iFolders are moved to the iFolder 3.7 or later server. You can choose to download the migrated iFolders on the 3.7 or later server to the client machine. However, those iFolders might already exist on the client machine. If this is the case, use the merge functionality to avoid unnecessary data transfer from server to the client. To merge migrated 2. x iFolders with 3.7 or later iFolders, Migrate the 2. x iFolders to the iFolder 3.7 or later domain. Convert the 2. x iFolders on the local machine to normal folders. Select the server copy of each iFolder and click Merge to folder . To merge the content, select the normal folder and click OK . </content>

  <title>Managing Passphrases for Encrypted iFolders</title>
  <url>../managingpassphrse.html</url>
  <content>Managing Passphrases for Encrypted iFolders An encrypted iFolder has a unique data encryption key that is auto-generated during iFolder creation. The key is encrypted by using a passphrase provided by the user and also by using the public key of the recovery agent. The recovery agent is selected during the iFolder account creation process if the iFolder administrator has enabled the encryption policy on the server. If the iFolder administrator has enabled encryption, a dialog box is displayed during iFolder creation for you to enter your passphrase. iFolder uses the passphrase to generate a unique encryption key to encrypt or decrypt the iFolder data on the iFolder server. If you forget the passphrase, you cannot access the iFolder data. You must reset your passphrase to gain access to the iFolder data. Recovering an encrypted iFolder Use the Passphrase Recovery Wizard to reset the passphrase and recover an encrypted iFolder. Follow the steps given below to launch the Passphrase Recovery Wizard: In the iFolder browser, click Security &gt; Forgot Passphrase to launch the wizard. From the iFolder Account list, select the domain for which the passphrase must be reset and click Forward . During the iFolder account creation process, if Server_Default option was selected as the recovery agent, then the Set New Passphrase page is displayed.To reset the new passphrase, see . On the other hand, if you selected a recovery agent other than Server_Default, then you must reset the passphrase using . Resetting the passphrase when recovery agent is Server_Default To set the new passphrase, perform the following steps: In the Set New Passphrase page, specify the new passphrase in the New Passphrase field. Re-enter the new passphrase in the Confirm Passphrase field . Specify the password in the Password field, then click Forward . After the passphrase is reset successfully, click Finish to close the wizard. Resetting the passphrase when recovery agent is not Server_Default To reset the passphrase when the recovery agent selected is not Server_Default , follow the steps given below: The Welcome page of the wizard displays information regarding the information you need to reset the passphrase. Click Forward to display the Passphrase Recovery Mechanism page. There are three methods you can use within the wizard to reset your passphrase: Using the secret file and its password: The secret file and its password are used to reset the passphrase. If you have maintained the secret file and its password, you can use the wizard to specify the location of the secret file and provide its password. To reset the paasphrase using the secret file, see . You obtain the secret file and its password from the iFolder administrator. Using the new data file: The new data file can also be used to reset the passphrase. You can get the new data file from the administrator after performing an export operation of the old data file. To reset the passphrase using the new data file, see . Exporting the old data file: If you don't have the secret file or the new data file, you can use the wizard to export the old data file, then you e-mail the file to your administrator. When the administrator sends back the new data file, you can use the wizard to reset your passphrase. To export the old data file, see . The following table summarizes the decisions you make. Settings Description iFolder Account list Displays the list of configured iFolder accounts. By default the first logged in account is selected. Location of secret file Denotes the location of the private key file of the certificate that can be obtained from the iFolder administrator. Secret password Represents the password to the secret key file. One time password Represents the password that is used by the administrator to encrypt the new data file. Location of new data file Denotes the location of the decrypted key file. The new data file is obtained from the iFolder administrator after performing an export operation of old data file. Location to save old data File Denotes the location to save the exported key file. After exporting the old data file, you can e-mail it to your administrator. The administrator then sends you the new data file. New Passphrase Represents the new passphrase that you enter which is used to encrypt the unique data encryption key that is auto generated during iFolder creation. Confirm Passphrase Represents the new passphrase that you must re-enter. Using the Secret File to Reset the Passphrase To reset the passphrase using the secret file, perform the following steps: Select I have the secret file and its password option, then click Forward .

  <title>Resolving File Conflicts</title>
  <url>../conflicts.html</url>
  <content>Resolving File Conflicts Conflicts can occur between file versions saved at the same time on different computers, or when a filename differs by case only. When conflicts occur, the file is stored in the conflict area and the file is flagged with a status of Name Conflict . The iFolder Error icon is displayed on the iFolder. If the Notify of conflicts option is enabled in your iFolder Preferences, an alert is also sent to the notification area. You can control the pop-up behavior of notifications by setting your preference in the iFolder Preferences General tab. To resolve file conflicts, see the following: Resolving File Version Conflicts To resolve file version conflicts, you must select the correct version in the Conflict Resolution dialog box. In the notification area, right-click the iFolder Services icon , then click iFolders to open the iFolder browser. Select the iFolder in conflict , then click Resolve to open the Resolve Conflicts dialog box. You can view two versions of the same file: Local Version: File saved on your local machine. Server Version: File saved on the server. You can view the details about the file on your local machine and the file on the server to determine which version of the file you want to keep. Click Open for each file to view the files. Select any of the following options for Save to iFolder based on your preference. Local Version: Select this option if you want to save the local version to the iFolder. Server Version: Select this option if you want to save the server version to the iFolder. Select Enable to enable the Save to Conflict Bin option. When you enable this option, the file in conflict is automatically selected to be saved in the Conflict bin. Your selection decides which version to be saved in the Conflict bin locally for later use. When you are done resolving the conflict, click Save . Resolving Filename Conflicts Filename conflicts occur when the names of the local file version and the server file version differ by case. The content might differ, or it might be the same. These type of conflicts can be resolved by renaming the files, but be careful about where you rename the file. If the content is the same, you can rename one of the files by using the Resolve Conflicts dialog box. If the content is different, make sure to make a copy of the local file and give it a different name, then return to the Resolve Conflicts dialog box and save the server version of the file. This allows both versions of the file to exist in the iFolder with different filenames. If you rename a file version within the Resolve Conflicts dialog box, that version of the file overwrites the other, and the content of the other file is destroyed. In the notification area, right-click the iFolder Services icon , then click iFolders to open the iFolder browser. Select the file in conflict , then click Resolve to open the Resolve Conflicts dialog box. Confirm that it is a file name conflict, and determine whether the content is the same or different. Do one of the following: If the content is the same, rename one of the files, click Save This Version , then click OK to close the Resolve Conflicts dialog box. You are done. If the content is different, continue with . Close the Resolve Conflicts dialog box. Open a file manager and navigate to the local copy of the file in conflict. Copy the file and save it with a unique name in the iFolder. iFolder synchronizes the file as a new file to the server and member computers. Return to the Resolve Conflicts dialog box, select the server version of the file, click Save this Version , then click OK . The server version of the file downloads to your local machine and overwrites the local copy of the file by that name. </content>

  <title>Moving an iFolder</title>
  <url>../movelocation.html</url>
  <content>Moving an iFolder After you create an iFolder, the path to the iFolder is static. You cannot move an iFolder from its original location to another location on your local computer and have it remain an iFolder. Moving the iFolder breaks the link between the synchronization database and the folder you converted to an iFolder. To move an iFolder on the computer where you created it: In a file manager or the iFolder browser, select the iFolder you want to move. Revert the iFolder to a normal folder.

  <content>Novell iFolder Migration And Upgrade This section discusses user-friendly migration to iFolder 3.7 or later client from the Novell iFolder 2. x client. It also discusses the upgrade of the client from iFolder 3. x to iFolder 3.7 or later. </content>

  <title>Migrating from iFolder 2.x to iFolder 3.7 or later</title>
  <url>../migration.html</url>
  <content>Migrating from iFolder 2. x to iFolder 3.7 or later This section discusses the following: Understanding the Migration Process Novell iFolder provides a simple migration from iFolder 2. x client to iFolder 3.7 or later client. The Migration Assistant provided in the iFolder client helps you migrate the existing iFolder 2. x data quickly and easily. During the startup, the Migration Assistant detects the 2. x installation and prompts you to migrate your data. During the data migration, it prompts you again to convert the existing folders or to make a copy of the 2. x iFolder. For more information on this, refer . iFolder prompts you about the resynchronization of the files to 3.7 or later server, and asks whether you need to retain the 2. x client until the synchronization is complete. During this process, only the data gets migrated, hence, the user has to set the preference in the new client. Migration Procedure Install the iFolder client for iFolder 3.7 or later server, then configure your account for the iFolder 3.7 or later enterprise server. For information on installing the client and setting up the account, see . In the iFolder browser, create one or more iFolders on your local computer. You can use any valid name for an iFolder. Do not create an iFolder in the same directory path as your current iFolder 2. x directory. For information, see . The iFolder displays a message about the existence of previous version data, and a request for a migration. Click OK to open a list of available 2. x iFolders. Select the 2. x iFolders you want to migrate. Click Migrate to appear the Migration Assistant. You can also reach the Migration Assistant by iFolder &gt; Migration &gt; Migrate from iFolder 2.x . Migration Assistant takes you through the Migration process to complete your data migration. Click Forward to display the Migration options. Select one of the following: Migrate the iFolder and disconnect it from 2.x domain : Select this option to disconnect the existing folder from the iFolder 2. x domain after migrating it to 3.7 or later. Create a copy of the iFolder and migrate: Select this option to create a copy of the iFolder 2. x files and convert them to iFolder 3.7 or later. This does not remove the files from the ifolder 2. x domain even after you migrate the files to iFolder 3.7 or later. If you select this option, you can also select Copy the parent folder if you want to copy not only the contents of the 2. x folder, but the parent folder as well. If you leave this option deselected, only the contents of the selected folder will be migrated to 3.7 or later. Click Browse to find the location to save the migrated folder. For example, c:/Documents and Settings/&lt;user name&gt;/ifolder2dir is a 2. x iFolder and dir1 and dir2 are the directories under ifolder2dir . When you select the option Copy the parent directory , it create the ifolder2dir in the new location and the directories dir1 and dir2 are copied to it. If the option remains deselected, only the directories dir1 and dir2 are moved to the specified location. Click Forward to select the domain and Security options as follows: Select the domain from the drop-down list. Select the desired security option: Select Encrypted to encrypt the selected iFolder. If you did not set your passphrase during login, iFolder prompts you to enter the passphrase. You can skip this option and set the passphrase later. If you are not currently connected to the iFolder domain, it prompts you to connect to the domain. Select Shared to share the iFolder with other members in the iFolder domain. You can migrate an encrypted 2. x iFolder to shared folder. When you attempt to migrate an encrypted 2. x iFolder to a shared folder, it prompts you to verify the action. Click OK to confirm your action. Click Forward to migrate the selected iFolder. Verify that the information you have entered is correct, if necessary, click Back to return to previous pages to make corrections. If the given information is correct, click Migrate to begin migration. Click Back to go back and make any necessary changes. Click Finish to complete the migration. </content>

  <title>Upgrading iFolder 3.x Clients</title>
  <url>../bctryt7.html</url>
  <content>Upgrading iFolder 3. x Clients This section discusses the following: Before upgrading your 3.4.1 client, you must back up your local Simias store. If you don’t do the backup, you lose all configuration information from the computer because it deletes the Simias store when the upgrade fails. Automatically Upgrading to iFolder 3.7 or later Versions The automatic upgrade is possible only if you have root access rights, because the process needs to install the RPM packages. The root password is requested during the upgrade. If you do not have root access rights, the package is not installed automatically. However, the client packages are downloaded to a temporary location. The Linux client is downloaded to /tmp/&lt;32chardir&gt;/ifolder3-linux.tar.gz . This enables you to upgrade it later because the location contains two install scripts that you can run manually. Until you upgrade the client, you cannot connect to the iFolder 3.7 or later domain with an iFolder 3. x client. From an iFolder 3. x client earlier than iFolder 3.7, try to connect to the iFolder server. You are prompted about whether you want to upgrade. Click Yes to automatically upgrade your iFolder 3. x client. For iFolder 3.4.1, if you click No and attempt to connect the iFolder 3.4.1 client to the iFolder 3.7 or later server, it displays an error message. Click OK to dismiss the message. Manually Upgrading to iFolder 3.7 or later Versions Open a terminal. At the command prompt, run install-ifolder.sh . Enter the root password when it is requested. This closes the iFolder client if it is already running, then it updates the XSP Web server and iFolder client along with the Nautilus-ifolder3 plug-in. Start iFolder from the Application menu. </content>
