<h2 class="title"><span class="number">3.2</span> Guidelines for File
Types and Sizes to Not Synchronize</h2>

<p class="para">When the iFolder client is used with Novell iFolder 3.<span class="replaceable">x</span>,
your iFolder administrator might specify file type restrictions
and maximum file size restrictions at the system, user, or iFolder
level. Your account might also be restricted in the amount of space
you can use for the data in the iFolders you own. When you participate
in other iFolders, the space consumed on the server is counted against the
owner of that iFolder.</p>
<p class="para">Some file types are not good candidates for synchronization,
such as operating system files, hidden files created by a file manager,
or databases that are implemented as a collection of linked files.
You might include only key file types used for your business, or
exclude files that are likely unrelated to business, such as <span class="filename">.mp3</span> files. </p>
<h4 class="bridgehead" id="bweu18w"> Operating System Files</h4>

<p class="para">You should not convert system directories to iFolders. Most
system files change infrequently and it is better to keep an image
file of your basic system and key software than to attempt to synchronize those
files to the server.</p>
<h4 class="bridgehead" id="bwepcty"> Hidden Files</h4>

<p class="para">If your file system uses hidden files to track display preferences,
your administrator might restrict those file types to exclude them
from being synchronized on your system. Usually, hidden files are relevant
only to the particular computer where they were created, and they
change every time the file or directory is accessed. You do not
need to keep these files, and synchronizing them results in repeated
file conflict errors. </p>
<p class="para">For example, iFolder automatically excludes two hidden file
manager files called <span class="filename">thumbs.db</span> and <span class="filename">.DS_Store</span>.</p>
<h4 class="bridgehead" id="bwepcz5"> Database Files</h4>

<p class="para">iFolder synchronizes individual files or the changed portions
of individual files; it does not synchronize files as a set. If
you have a database file that is implemented as a collection of
linked files, do not try to synchronize them in an iFolder.</p>
<p class="para">Do not try to synchronize your GroupWise® data by
making the GroupWise archive, cache, or remote directories into
iFolders. If you do this, the GroupWise data files become corrupted
after synchronizing the file a few times. GroupWise needs the files
in the archive to be maintained as a set of files.</p>
