<div class="sect1" title="Guidelines for the Location and Use of iFolders" id="locguide">

<h2 class="title"><span class="number">3.1</span> Guidelines for the
Location and Use of iFolders</h2>

<p class="para">Generally, you can put iFolders anywhere on your local hard
drive when you create an iFolder or set up an iFolder that is shared
with you. However, there are some practical and specific limitations. Consider
the following guidelines for placing and using iFolders on your
computer:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul class="listbullet">
<li class="listitem">An iFolder’s name must be
a unique folder name in the directory where you put the iFolder.</li>
<li class="listitem">An iFolder’s name cannot contain the following
invalid characters:<pre class="screen">
\/:*?"&lt;&gt;|;
</pre>
<p class="listitem">For other naming conventions, see <a href="nameconv.html#nameconv">Section 3.3, Naming Conventions
for an iFolder and Its Folders and Files</a>.</p></li>
<li class="listitem">The iFolder must reside on a local hard drive; the
location cannot be on a network drive or non-physical drive.</li>
<li class="listitem">An iFolder cannot exist at the root of the hard
drive. </li>
<li class="listitem">An iFolder can be created only from a folder where
you have the file system access rights to read and write files.
When you set up a shared iFolder on a computer, you must have file system
access rights to the folder where you are placing the iFolder.</li>
<li class="listitem">An iFolder cannot contain or reside in an applications
folder such as the Program Files folder.</li>
<li class="listitem">The iFolder cannot contain or reside in the iFolder
metadata folder. The default location of the metadata folder is
as follows:
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul class="listbullet">
<li class="listitem">
<div class="formalpara" id="bx09dxu"><p class="title"><em class="title">Linux:</em>
In your home folder in the <span class="filename">.local\share</span> subdirectory</p></div>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<div class="formalpara" id="bx09ffv"><p class="title"><em class="title">Windows:</em>
In the <span class="filename">C:\Documents and Settings\<span class="replaceable">WindowsLogonUsername</span>\Local
Settings\Application Data\simias</span> directory</p></div>
</li></ul></div>
</li>
<li class="listitem">An iFolder cannot contain or reside in other iFolders,
including your Novell iFolder 2.1x iFolder.
<p class="listitem">iFolder does not support network folders as iFolders. For
example, iFolders cannot be the users’ network-based /home
directories that are mapped to the users’ workstations.
iFolder also does not support WebDAV access for users from their
desktop to their iFolder collection on the iFolder server’s
user-data volume.</p></li>
<li class="listitem">Although you can log in to more than one iFolder
account at a time, an iFolder can be associated with only one iFolder
account. You cannot synchronize one iFolder against multiple accounts.
When you create an iFolder, the iFolder can be shared only with
other users that are provisioned in the same iFolder server/domain.</li>
<li class="listitem">When multiple users share a computer, the local
copies of your iFolders are private to your storage space on the
disk if the file system supports privacy features, and if you configure
your system to use them.
<p class="listitem">On Windows, NTFS includes built-in security features such
as file and folder permissions and the Encrypting File System (EFS),
which is the technology used to store encrypted files on NTFS volumes.
These security features are not supported on FAT32 file systems.
Make sure the local login identities for users (other than the Administrator
identity, of course) do not have the Administrator rights or equivalent.
The Administrator user has access to all files and directories on
the computer. For shared computers where privacy and security are
essential for each user, the users can encrypt their local copy
of iFolder data with EFS or a third-party file system encryption.</p>
<p class="listitem">Linux and Macintosh file systems are designed for multi-user
environments. File permissions allow you to control access for the
user, groups, and others. A user’s personal files are typically set
with full permissions for the user and no access for the groups
and others settings. </p>
<p class="listitem">If you store iFolders locally on a FAT32 volume on Linux,
it requires special handling because FAT32 file systems are not
POSIX* compliant. For information, see <a href="createifolder.html#fat32mtpt">Section 3.5.3, Creating iFolders on a FAT32 Mount
Point (Linux)</a>.</p></li>
<li class="listitem">If users of the same computer share iFolders, multiple
copies of the iFolder can exist on the device, with a copy for each
user who downloads it from the server. Different local login identities
cannot share a single location for the shared iFolders.</li></ul></div>
