<h2 class="title"><span class="number">1.4</span> Key Features of
iFolder</h2>

<p class="para">Before you begin to use iFolder, it is important to understand
the following key features:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul class="listbullet">
<li class="listitem"><a href="keyfeatures.html#bawqka3">Section 1.4.1, iFolder Sharing</a></li>
<li class="listitem"><a href="keyfeatures.html#b9425tb">Section 1.4.2, iFolder Access Rights</a></li>

<div class="sect2" title="iFolder Sharing" id="bawqka3">

<h3 class="title"><span class="number">1.4.1</span> iFolder Sharing</h3>

<p class="para">Typically, when you work in multiple locations or in collaboration
with others, you must conscientiously manage file versions. With
iFolder, the most recent version of your files can follow you to
any computer where you have installed the iFolder client and created
an iFolder for them. iFolder also allows you to share multiple iFolders
and their separate content with other authorized users. For more
information on shared iFolder, see <a href="keyfeatures.html#bawqvmt">Shared iFolders</a>.</p>
<p class="para">The iFolder client supports sharing by synchronizing files
across multiple computers through a central server. It allows you
to do the following:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul class="listbullet">
<li class="listitem">Share files across computers</li>
<li class="listitem">Share files with others</li>
<li class="listitem">Own multiple iFolders</li>
<li class="listitem">Participate in multiple iFolders that other users
share with you</li>
<li class="listitem">Participate as the owner or a member of iFolders
in multiple accounts</li></ul></div>

<p class="para">You work with iFolders directly in your file manager or in
the iFolder browser that is part of the client. Within the iFolder,
you can set up any subdirectory structure that suits your personal
or corporate work habits. The subdirectory structure is constant
across all member iFolders. </p>
<div class="sect3" title="Shared iFolders" id="bawqvmt">

<h4 class="title"> Shared iFolders</h4>

<p class="para">An iFolder is a local directory that selectively shares and
synchronizes files via a central server with a user-specified users.
The iFolder files are accessible to all iFolder members and can
be changed by those with the rights to do so. You can access your
iFolders across multiple workstations and share them with others.</p>
<p class="para">You decide who participates in each iFolder and the level
of access for each member. Similarly, you can participate in shared
iFolders that are owned by others in your collaboration environment.
When you share an iFolder, member users with the Write permission
can modify the directory structure, and those changes apply to all
copies of the iFolder. Each user can locate the shared iFolder anywhere
on his or her own computer if it satisfies the <a href="locguide.html#locguide">Section 3.1, Guidelines for the
Location and Use of iFolders</a>.</p>
</div>

</div>

<div class="sect2" title="iFolder Access Rights" id="b9425tb">

<h3 class="title"><span class="number">1.4.2</span> iFolder Access Rights</h3>

<p class="para">The iFolder client supports the owner and three levels of
access for members of an iFolder: </p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul class="listbullet">
<li class="listitem">
<div class="formalpara" id="b9425tc"><p class="title"><em class="title">Owner:</em>
Only one user serves as the owner of an iFolder. This is typically
the user who creates the iFolder. The owner user can use the iFolder
client to transfer ownership to another member of the iFolder. </p></div>

<p class="listitem">The owner of an iFolder has the Full Control right. This user
has read/write access to the iFolder, manages membership
and access rights for member users, and can remove the Full Control
right for any member.</p></li>
<li class="listitem">
<div class="formalpara" id="b9425td"><p class="title"><em class="title">Full Control:</em>
A member of the shared iFolder, with the Full Control access
right. This member has read/write access to the iFolder
and manages membership and access rights for all users except the
owner. </p></div>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<div class="formalpara" id="b9425te"><p class="title"><em class="title">Read/Write:</em>
A member of the shared iFolder, with the Read/Write
access right to the directories and files in the iFolder. This member
can modify a file, but the local changes are  synchronized to other
members’ copies of the iFolder. </p></div>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<div class="formalpara" id="b9425tf"><p class="title"><em class="title">Read Only:</em>
A member of the shared iFolder, with the Read Only access
right to directories and files in the iFolder. This member can modify
a file, but the local changes are not synchronized to other members’ copies
of the iFolder.</p></div>
</li></ul></div>

<p class="para">Any iFolder user can own some iFolders and be a member of
other iFolders. As an owner user, you always have the Full Control
right. As a member user, your level of access in each shared iFolder can
differ, depending on the access granted to you by any member with
the Full Control right.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect2" title="File Synchronization " id="b9425tg">

<h3 class="title"><span class="number">1.4.3</span> File Synchronization </h3>

<p class="para">When you are connected to the server, iFolder can synchronize
iFolder membership and files in the background as you work. When
you set up an iFolder account, you can enable <span class="guimenu">Remember
My Password</span> so that iFolder can remember the password
on that machine, and next time when you launch iFolder, it is automatically
connect to the server and synchronize the data without prompts  for
password.</p>
<p class="para">You can configure the iFolder client to run automatically
each time you log in to your computer’s desktop environment.
The session runs in the background as you work with files in your
local iFolders, tracking and logging any changes you make. </p>
<p class="para">You can synchronize the files manually or at specified intervals.</p>
<p class="para">iFolder 3.6 also has delta synchronization capabilities. When
you make any changes to an iFolder file, only the deltas or changes
get synchronized to the server. In other words, Delta synchronization only
retrieves updates since the last synchronization between the iFolder
client and the server. This increases the efficiency since it reduces
the synchronization time. </p>
</div>

<div class="sect2" title="Encryption" id="b7x5io1">

<h3 class="title"><span class="number">1.4.4</span> Encryption</h3>

<p class="para">iFolder 3.6 provides higher security for your confidential
iFolder files, to protect them from intentional or unintentional
access by unauthorized people. In the past, data security was not
ensured on the server side, so the data was accessible to the administrator
or to anyone who gained unauthorized access to the server. In addition
when you access iFolder files via an ISP provider, there is a chance
that an unauthorized individual can inadvertently stumble across
your confidential files. Now, you can encrypt and save your files
on on the server, and retrieve them  through a passphrase known
only to you. If you forget your passphrase, the recovery agent you
have selected during the creation of the encrypted iFolder helps
you recover your data. For more information on encryption, see <a href="managingpassphrse.html#managingpassphrse">Managing Passphrase for Encrypted iFolders</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect2" title="Enhanced Web Access" id="b7x6cp3">

<h3 class="title"><span class="number">1.4.5</span> Enhanced Web Access</h3>

<p class="para">iFolder 3.6 provides an enhanced Web interface that allows
you to access your iFolder files on remote servers. With the enhanced
Web Access console, you can use a Web browser to access your files
on the iFolder server from any workstation without the iFolder client.
The  Web Access client enables you to perform all the operations
of the iFolder client.</p>
<p class="para">When compared to the previous iFolder versions, iFolder 3.6
 lets you create, browse, share, upload and delete iFolders via
the enhanced Web access console. Mobile users can also make use
of this facility through the Web.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect2" title="Migration" id="b9lux1e">

<h3 class="title"><span class="number">1.4.6</span> Migration</h3>

<p class="para">Novell iFolder 3.6 provides a simple, hassle-free migration
from iFolder 2.<span class="replaceable">x</span> to the iFolder client
for Novell iFolder 3.6. The Migration Wizard provided in the iFolder
3.6 client helps you migrate the existing iFolder 2.<span class="replaceable">x</span> data
to iFolder 3.6 quickly and easily. For more information, see <a href="coexistmig.html#coexistmig">Novell iFolder
Migration And Upgrade </a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect2" title="Default iFolder" id="bayydrd">

<h3 class="title"><span class="number">1.4.7</span> Default iFolder</h3>

<p class="para">iFolder 3.6 allows you to set up a default iFolder when you
configure a new account. When you configure a new iFolder account,
iFolder automatically check for the presence of default iFolder.
If you have not created one, iFolder prompts you to create one.
If a default iFolder is already exists, iFolder client prompts you
to download. You are also allowed to ignore both these options.
For more information see, <a href="accounts.html#bbba119">Step 6</a> in the section <a href="accounts.html#accounts">Section 2.2, Configuring an iFolder
Account</a>. </p>
</div>

<div class="sect2" title="Synchronization Log" id="b9425th">

<h3 class="title"><span class="number">1.4.8</span> Synchronization Log</h3>

<p class="para">The synchronization log displays a log of your iFolder background
activity, such as uploading and downloading files for different
iFolders, excluded files and non-synchronized files. </p>
