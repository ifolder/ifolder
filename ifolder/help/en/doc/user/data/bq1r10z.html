<div class="Topic" title="Benefits of iFolder">

<h2 class="TOPIC-TITLE"><br />Benefits of iFolder</h2>
<p class="TOPIC">Typically, when you work in multiple locations or in collaboration with others, you must conscientiously manage file versions. With iFolder, the most recent version of your files can follow you to any computer where you have installed the iFolder client and set up the shared iFolder. iFolder also allows you to share multiple iFolders and their separate content with other authorized users. You decide who participates in each iFolder and the level of access for each member. Similarly, you can participate in shared iFolders that are owned by others in your collaboration environment.</p>
<p class="TOPIC">In the following example, Ulrik owns an iFolder named Denmark and shares it via his iFolder enterprise account with Nigel, Luc, and Alice. Nigel travels frequently, so he also set up the iFolder on his laptop. iFolder members can upload and download files from the Denmark iFolder from anywhere, using the iFolder Web Access server. In addition, Alice shares a non-work iFolder with her friend Ulrick.</p>

<em class= "FIGURE">Figure 1 </em><br /><em class="FIGURE">Collaboration and Sharing with iFolder</em><br /><img src="../graphics/nif3_share002_a.gif" alt="" />
<p class="TOPIC">The iFolder client synchronizes the most recent version of documents to all authorized users of your shared iFolder. All that you and other iFolder members need is an active network connection and the iFolder client. With an enterprise server, your iFolders are stored centrally for all iFolder members.  </p>
<p class="TOPIC">iFolder provides the following benefits:</p>
<ul class="LISTBULLET">
<li class="BULLETITEM">Integrates with your native desktop environment, making it easy to create and manage multiple iFolders.</li>

<li class="BULLETITEM">Is highly scalable and flexible, with no practical limit on the number of iFolders per user or on the number of members per iFolder.</li>

<li class="BULLETITEM">Allows you to create iFolders and store files on a central enterprise server for anytime, anywhere access.</li>

<li class="BULLETITEM">Allows you to easily and selectively share personal and business files with anyone.</li>

<li class="BULLETITEM">Allows you to control the access level of users who share your iFolders.</li>

<li class="BULLETITEM">Transparently updates your files to the iFolder server and member iFolders on multiple workstations.</li>

<li class="BULLETITEM">Tracks and logs changes made while you work offline, and synchronizes those changes when you go online.</li>

<li class="BULLETITEM">Provides secure authentication of member iFolders to synchronize data.</li>

<li class="BULLETITEM">Offers an alternative to exchanging files via e-mail, which avoids the file-size limits on e-mail attachments and reduces your e-mail storage requirements.</li>
</ul>
