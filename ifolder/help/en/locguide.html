<h1 class="title"> Guidelines for the Location and Use of iFolders</h1>

<p class="para">Generally, you can put iFolders anywhere on your local hard drive when you create an iFolder or set up an iFolder that is shared with you. However, there are some practical and specific limitations. Consider the following guidelines for placing and using iFolders on your computer:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul class="listbullet">
<li class="listitem">
<p class="listitem">An iFolder’s name must be a unique folder name in the directory where you put the iFolder.</p></li>
<li class="listitem">
<p class="listitem">An iFolder’s name cannot contain the following invalid characters:</p><pre class="screen">
\/:*?"&lt;&gt;|;
</pre>
<p class="listitem">For other naming conventions, see <a href="nameconv.html">Naming Conventions for an iFolder and Its Folders and Files</a>.</p></li>
<li class="listitem">
<p class="listitem">The iFolder must reside on a local hard drive; the location cannot be on a network drive or non-physical drive.</p></li>
<li class="listitem">
<p class="listitem">An iFolder cannot exist at the root of the hard drive. </p></li>
<li class="listitem">
<p class="listitem">An iFolder can be created only from a folder where you have the file system access rights to read and write files. When you set up a shared iFolder on a computer, you must have file system access rights to the folder where you are placing the iFolder.</p></li>
<li class="listitem">
<p class="listitem">An iFolder cannot contain or reside in an applications folder such as the Program Files folder.</p></li>
<li class="listitem">
<p class="listitem">The iFolder cannot contain or reside in the iFolder metadata folder. The default location of the metadata folder is as follows:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul class="listbullet">
<li class="listitem">
<div class="formalpara" id="bx09dxu">
                <p class="title"><em class="title">Linux:</em>
                In your home folder in the <span class="filename">&lt;Home Directory&gt;\.local\share</span>\<span class="filename">simias</span> subdirectory</p>
              </div>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<div class="formalpara" id="bx09ffv">
                <p class="title"><em class="title">Windows:</em>
                In the <span class="filename">C:\Documents and Settings\<span class="replaceable">WindowsLogonUsername</span>\Local Settings\Application Data\simias</span> directory</p>
              </div>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<div class="formalpara" id="bcto9jx">
                <p class="title"><em class="title">Macintosh:</em>
                In the <span class="filename">$HOME/.local/share/simias</span></p>
              </div>
</li></ul></div>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p class="listitem">An iFolder cannot contain or reside in other iFolders, including your Novell iFolder 2.<span class="replaceable">x</span> iFolder.</p>
<p class="listitem">iFolder does not support network folders as iFolders. For example, iFolders cannot be the users’ network-based /home directories that are mapped to the users’ workstations. iFolder also does not support WebDAV access for users from their desktop to their iFolder collection on the iFolder server’s user-data volume.</p></li>
<li class="listitem">
<p class="listitem">Although you can log in to more than one iFolder account at a time, an iFolder can be associated with only one iFolder account. You cannot synchronize one iFolder against multiple accounts. When you create an iFolder, the iFolder can be shared only with other users and LDAPGroups that are provisioned in the same iFolder server or domain.</p></li>
<li class="listitem">
<p class="listitem">An iFolder is available to all the members of an LDAPGroup when it is shared with that LDAPGroup.</p></li>
<li class="listitem">
<p class="listitem">When multiple users share a computer, the local copies of your iFolders are private to your storage space on the disk if the file system supports privacy features, and if you configure your system to use them.</p>
<p class="listitem">On Windows, NTFS includes built-in security features such as file and folder permissions and the Encrypting File System (EFS), which is the technology used to store encrypted files on NTFS volumes. These security features are not supported on FAT32 file systems. Make sure the local login identities for users (other than the Administrator identity, of course) do not have the Administrator rights or equivalent. The Administrator user has access to all files and directories on the computer. For shared computers where privacy and security are essential for each user, the users can encrypt their local copy of iFolder data with EFS or a third-party file system encryption.</p>
<p class="listitem">Linux and Macintosh file systems are designed for multi-user environments. File permissions allow you to control access for the user, groups, and others. A user’s personal files are typically set with full permissions for the user and no access for the groups and others settings. </p>
<p class="listitem">If you store iFolders locally on a FAT32 volume on Linux, it requires special handling because FAT32 file systems are not POSIX* compliant. For information, see <a href="createifolder.html#fat32mtpt">Creating iFolders on a FAT32 Mount Point (Linux)</a>.</p></li>
<li class="listitem">
<p class="listitem">If users of the same computer share iFolders, multiple copies of the iFolder can exist on the device, with a copy for each user who downloads it from the server. Different local login identities cannot share a single location for the shared iFolders.</p></li></ul></div>
