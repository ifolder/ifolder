- Added gconf-sharp2 and gnome-sharp2 to the requires list to resolve

* Mon Mar 27 2006 - jhargadon@novell.com 
- Removed unnecessary ifolderuser.png file
- Updated help files
- Put Simias merge module back into iFolder install
* Mon Mar 20 2006 - jhargadon@novell.com 
- Added code to be able to check with the server when there are
  client upgrades available.
* Mon Mar 13 2006 - jhargadon@novell.com
- Fixed a problem where we'd show "Server unavailable" for the state
  of workgroup iFolders when the current machine is the Master.
- Fixed a problem where we weren't passing in the command-line arguments
  to create the Simias Manager. This prevented simias from being able
  to attach to the console so debug output would be sent to ifolder's
  console window. You can now start iFolder with these parameters to
  get simias console output:
    --showconsole --verbose
- Fix for Bug 155559 - Attempting to open the conflict help throws
  an error on SuSE Linux 10.0.
  I fixed up the HelpURL() function to check for null or an invalid
  length language code. If either of those is detected, "en" will be used.
- modified the specfile by removing *-sharp2 from the Requires to resolve
  bug #150899
- Fix for Bug 155244 - iFolder 3.4 client continually throws the
  following error after running the account setup wizard -
  (ifolder:20295): Gtk-CRITICAL **: gtk_progress_bar_pulse: assertion
  `GTK_IS_PROGRESS_BAR (pbar)' failed.
  The timer to move the progress bar was not being disposed.
- Added Label.UseUnderline = false so that the name of the iFolder
  and path don't get treated like a mnemonic string.
- Added code in the event that receives the iFolderAdded to force
  the iFolderHolder.State to be iFolderState.Initial so that it shows
  that it's "Waiting to synchronize" and never "OK" initially. I was
  seeing this case if I downloaded a LOT of iFolders all at once while
  an existing iFolder was busy synchronizing.
- Fixed a problem where the client would not shut down cleanly when
  the exception dialog appeared (which means a bigger problem occurred).
  When a bad exception happens, the client will now close cleanly
- Added GConf settings for a couple of debug menus so that they are
  not shown by default but can be enabled by GConf later if we need them to.
- Fix for Bug 135750 ?\226?\128?\147 Help URL always defaults to en
  instead of the LANG specified by the client.
  "en" was hardcoded anytime a user wanted to view help files. It now
  uses System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture.Name.
- Fix for Bug 154781 - Double Clicking on the Share UI is broken on
  the Linux client.
  Modified the code so that underpriveleged users cannot change
  rights with the Access button, double-clicking a user, or
  right-clicking. I also modified the code so that when a user
  clicks the "Change owner" checkbox, the full-control radio button
  is automatically selected and the other options are grayed out.
